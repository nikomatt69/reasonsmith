/**
 * The colour tokens, and the one function that maps a result to a colour.
 *
 * The tokens live apart from the components because in this UI a colour is a *claim*, not a
 * decoration: green says satisfied and red says violated, and a reader who learns that reads every
 * screen through it. `resultTone` is the only place that mapping is made.
 *
 * Three things a reader must not break, each of them a rule this repository states elsewhere and
 * this module is bound by:
 *
 *   - **Satisfied is always green and violated is always red, at every rung.** The colour carries
 *     the verdict and nothing else.
 *   - **The rung is never a colour ramp.** `docs/what-this-does-not-do.md` §3 is titled *A rung is
 *     not a grade*: the lattice ranks how a conclusion was reached, never how much to believe it, and
 *     "a report full of `proved` verdicts is not a better report than one full of `observed`
 *     verdicts". A palette that shaded `observed` amber and `proved` blue would teach the opposite in
 *     a glance and no caption could undo it, so the rung is rendered as a *word* and never as a hue.
 *   - **The third family is neither.** `not evaluated`, `unattainable` and `not applicable` are not
 *     weak passes and not soft failures; they are the absence of a verdict. They get a muted family
 *     of their own so a reader can never mistake one for a clean result — which is the whole reason
 *     the result model keeps `strength = null` distinct from a low rung.
 *
 * `satisfied` and `violated` are also kept apart on the *hue* channel and not only on lightness, so a
 * terminal palette that desaturates both toward a common grey still shows them as different colours.
