# RESULTS — measured, not asserted

This is the evidence artifact for `reasonsmith`'s own claims: an environment was actually built, `torch` and `nesyarena[learning]` were actually installed, both suites were actually run, and the demo was executed twice and diffed.

## Summary of Measured Numbers

| Category | Target / Metric | Measured Result | Details / Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **`reasonsmith` Suite** | `pytest` | **35 passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped | Counts the v0.1 suite as it stood at the measured commit — **stale by construction**, see the note under this table |
| | `ruff check .` | **0 findings** | All linter checks passed cleanly |
| **`nesyarena` Suite** | Pytest Header | **107 collected items** / 3 skipped modules | Measured with `torch` & `torchvision` installed |
| *(with torch present)* | Pytest Summary | **1 failed, 100 passed, 5 skipped, 4 errors** | Execution time: 23.04s |
| | `test_learning_parity.py` | 5 passed, 2 skipped | Skipped tests require `ltn` (`backends` extra) |
| | `test_e6_findings.py` | 4 errors | Error fixture requires `ltn.fuzzy_ops` |
| | `test_oracle.py` | 1 failed | Failed test requires `problog` (`oracles` extra) |
| | Uncollected modules | 3 skipped | `deeplog`, `deepproblog`, `problog_kbest` |
| **Demo Execution** | Determinism (2 runs) | **Byte-identical** (0 diff lines) | `md5sum`: `c5976971e24a86886f1e0ad54f0b9ce9` (561 lines) — the transcript as it stood at the measured commit; the demo has since grown four sections, see the Contributor Demos Note |

**What the `35 passed` figure does and does not count.** Every number in this file is a measurement taken at `reasonsmith` commit `9411ca60a70c0d4f72f12a038e01d9d65c70c03f`, and none of them is re-measured by later work except where a later dated note says so and names its own commit — that is what makes them reconstructible, and it is also what makes this one stale. Section 2's `35 passed` counts the suite as it stood then, and the v0.2 work added since (`verdict.py`, `spec.py`, `sut.py`, `report.py`, `rulelang.py`, `adapters/`, `engines/`, `cli.py`, the `packs/` requirement packs, and `tests/test_v02_core.py`, `tests/test_v02_stage2.py` plus `tests/test_v02_stage3.py`) adds tests to that number. Read `35` as the v0.1 suite's count at that commit, never as the current suite's: for the current count, run `pytest` yourself. Those v0.2 files are new alongside v0.1 rather than changes to it, and `evidence.py`, `certificate.py` and `conformance.py` are untouched. `demo.py` is the one exception: it now carries four additional Table 7 demos contributed by Alessandro Boni (rows 1, 2, 5 and 6), which append sections 6–9 to the transcript and leave sections 1–5 byte-identical. So section 3's per-case figures still describe the code as it is today; its transcript length and hash do not, and the re-measured ones are in the Contributor Demos Note. Section 1 (nesyarena's suite) was measured under `nesyarena` commit `fdf0d5eb54c7af181e15b94d3b68d5d6bb7712ec` and was **not** re-measured under the PyPI release now pinned; it is expected to hold because that release's `tests/` and `experiments/` are byte-identical to the measured commit's — see the PyPI Release Note for what was checked and what was not.

## Environment & Provenance

Every number in this file is copied from a command's real output. The exact commands are given so a stranger can reproduce every one of them from `reasonsmith` commit `9411ca60a70c0d4f72f12a038e01d9d65c70c03f` (branch `fm/rs-prove-it`), the commit every measurement below was taken at. Every number here is that commit's and is not re-measured by later work, with one exception: the figures in the Contributor Demos Note (2026-08-01), which are labelled with the later commit they were measured at because the demo transcript itself changed there.

| Component / Tool | Version / Hash Details |
|---|---|
| **Date of Measurement** | 2026-07-31 |
| **Operating System** | Linux 7.0.0-28-generic |
| **Python** | 3.12.9 |
| **numpy** | 2.5.1 |
| **torch** | 2.13.0+cu130 |
| **torchvision** | 0.28.0+cu130 |
| **pytest** | 9.1.1 |
| **ruff** | 0.16.1 |
| **reasonsmith** | `0.1.0` (editable install), commit `9411ca60a70c0d4f72f12a038e01d9d65c70c03f` |
| **nesyarena** | `0.1.0` (PyPI release, built from commit `22b539bad6c3510fe457aa751141c5c4aa1483ea`), originally measured at pinned commit `fdf0d5eb54c7af181e15b94d3b68d5d6bb7712ec` (repinned to `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7`, then to the PyPI release, see notes below) |

### Repin Note (2026-07-31)

The measurements below were taken against `nesyarena` commit `fdf0d5eb54c7af181e15b94d3b68d5d6bb7712ec`. `nesyarena`'s owner then rewrote its git history to strip AI co-authorship trailers, which gave every commit a new hash: that old commit is no longer reachable from `nesyarena`'s default branch `main`, so `pip install` can no longer resolve it from there and `pyproject.toml` was repinned to `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7` instead, which is reachable from `main`. (That git pin has since been replaced by the PyPI release — see the PyPI Release Note below for what `pyproject.toml` pins now.)

(The old commit currently survives on the temporary rollback ref `refs/heads/backup/pre-coauthor-strip`, which is expected to be deleted; nothing here relies on it — reconstructibility stands on `main` alone.)

The hash changed, the content did not: both commits' `git cat-file -p <sha> | grep tree` report the identical tree `d050c86ef83b01bac972a0af3afa6f629a4a9972`, verified directly against both commits before this note was written. The figures below are still the original run's, quoted unedited. What was re-run against the new pin is exactly this and nothing more: `reasonsmith`'s own `pytest` suite (35 passed), `ruff check .` (no findings), and `python -m reasonsmith.demo` (561 lines, two runs, identical) — see "Full Transcript Provenance"; none of those moved. Section 1's figures are `nesyarena`'s *own* suite (`collected 107 items / 3 skipped`, `1 failed, 100 passed, 5 skipped, 4 errors`), measured under the old pin `fdf0d5eb54c7af181e15b94d3b68d5d6bb7712ec` in the separate torch environment, and they were **not** re-run against `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7`. They are expected to be unchanged because the two commits share the tree `d050c86ef83b01bac972a0af3afa6f629a4a9972` and so install identical content — but that is an expectation from tree identity, not a measurement. The old pin is kept in the table above for the historical record of what was actually run.

### PyPI Release Note (2026-07-31)

On 2026-07-31, `nesyarena` 0.1.0 was published to PyPI. `pyproject.toml` was updated from the git SHA dependency (`nesyarena @ git+https://github.com/eduardstan/nesyarena@57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7`) to the exact PyPI release pin `nesyarena==0.1.0`.

PyPI 0.1.0 was built from `nesyarena` commit `22b539bad6c3510fe457aa751141c5c4aa1483ea` (`build(nesyarena): prepare 0.1.0 PyPI release and widen CI matrix (#3)`), two commits ahead of the pin it replaces: `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7` → `782a135bd5fbfcde4c663beea74e71c61cee8157` (`ci: add GitHub Actions workflow to run test suite on push and PR (#2)`) → `22b539ba…`.

That commit is identified, not assumed, and both published artifacts were checked with `git hash-object` against the tree the GitHub API reports for that SHA:

- **sdist** `nesyarena-0.1.0.tar.gz`, sha256 `5e93f9e6fc4662fde1cf9d1b788a9b2573d4728605004a6317d57282d25b7d7c` — every file under `src/` hashes to the same git blob as that commit's, `pyproject.toml` included.
- **wheel** `nesyarena-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`, sha256 `20eebf9b2fc0d44ff5b99f00209a48b3547a56930b581181faf6b6c2c0d8bf47` — the artifact `pip install -e ".[dev]"` actually resolves, and so the one whose contents back the re-run figures below. All 19 modules it carries hash to that commit's blobs. It carries no `tests/` or `experiments/`, which is why running `nesyarena`'s own suite needs the separate clone in "Build and Reproduction Commands".

What the release commit changes relative to `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7` is two installed files — `src/nesyarena/__init__.py` (`__version__` `0.1.0.dev0` → `0.1.0`, the whole diff) and `pyproject.toml` — plus repository metadata that is not installed (`README.md`, `.gitignore`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/PUBLISHING.md`). The rest of `src/`, and all 45 files under `tests/` and `experiments/`, are byte-identical blobs across the two commits.

`reasonsmith`'s own test suite (`189 passed` on the suite as it stood on 2026-07-31, `35 passed` on v0.1 suite), `ruff check .` (0 findings), and `python -m reasonsmith.demo` (561 lines, two runs byte-identical, `md5sum` `c5976971e24a86886f1e0ad54f0b9ce9`) were re-run against PyPI `nesyarena==0.1.0` and confirmed fully passing and unchanged. Section 1's figures are `nesyarena`'s *own* suite, measured under `fdf0d5eb54c7af181e15b94d3b68d5d6bb7712ec` in the separate torch environment, and they were **not** re-run against the PyPI release. They are expected to be unchanged because `tests/` and `experiments/` are byte-identical across `fdf0d5eb…` → `57720fa…` (identical tree `d050c86ef83b01bac972a0af3afa6f629a4a9972`, see the Repin Note) → `22b539ba…`, and the installed source differs only in the `__version__` string — but that is an expectation from blob identity, not a measurement.

### Build and Reproduction Commands

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"                                   # reasonsmith + pinned nesyarena, no torch

# nesyarena's own suite needs its tests/ and experiments/ directories, which the pip-installed
# wheel does not carry (pip installs the built package, not the whole git repo). To run
# nesyarena's own suite at the commit PyPI 0.1.0 was built from, its repo is cloned separately
# and checked out to that commit, then its optional extras are installed into the same venv:
git clone https://github.com/eduardstan/nesyarena /path/to/nesyarena-src
cd /path/to/nesyarena-src && git checkout 22b539bad6c3510fe457aa751141c5c4aa1483ea  # source of nesyarena==0.1.0;
                                              # was 57720fa..., before that fdf0d5e...: same tests/, same experiments/
pip install -e ".[learning,reporting,dev]"   # torch, torchvision + pyyaml/matplotlib needed
                                              # only so tests/test_e6_findings.py can *collect*
```

`nesyarena[learning]` (`torch>=2.4`, `torchvision>=0.20`) is what the task and the README's prior caveat named. `reporting` (`pyyaml`, `matplotlib`) was added on top of that because `tests/test_e6_findings.py` imports `yaml` at module scope — without it the module still fails to collect, for a reason that has nothing to do with torch. Two further nesyarena extras, `oracles` (`problog`, `pysdd`) and `backends` (`ltn`, `deeplog`, `deepproblog`), were **not** installed — that was not in scope here, and the gaps it leaves are reported below rather than papered over.

`reasonsmith`'s own `pyproject.toml` is untouched: `torch` is not a declared dependency of this package, only of the separate nesyarena checkout used to measure nesyarena's own suite.

## 1. `nesyarena`'s Own Suite, with Torch Present

```sh
cd /path/to/nesyarena-src && python -m pytest -q -rA
```

The same suite, invoked as `python -m pytest -o addopts=""`, printed these two lines, quoted verbatim — so the counts here are pytest's own, not derived:

```text
collected 107 items / 3 skipped
============= 1 failed, 100 passed, 5 skipped, 4 errors in 23.04s ==============
```

The 3 in `107 items / 3 skipped` are whole modules skipped at collection time, which pytest counts separately from the 107 collected items; the 5 in the summary line is those 3 plus the 2 tests skipped while running, both of them listed by file and line in the transcript below.

Both modules the README used to say could not even be collected — `tests/test_e6_findings.py` and `tests/test_learning_parity.py` — collect and run now. `test_learning_parity.py` runs 5 tests to a pass; `test_e6_findings.py` is the one module that still cannot complete, and not because of torch:

- **`test_learning_parity.py`**: 5 passed, 2 skipped (`could not import 'ltn'`) — those two need the `backends` extra (LTNtorch), not `learning`.
- **`test_e6_findings.py`**: 4 errors, all `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'ltn'` — the module collects fine, but every test shares a fixture that calls `run_treatment`, which reaches `BatchStructure.ltn_prod`, which lazy-imports `ltn.fuzzy_ops`. Same missing dependency as above.
- **`test_oracle.py::test_wmc_against_problog_battery`**: 1 failed, `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'problog'` — needs the `oracles` extra.
- **3 whole modules skipped at collection time**: `test_deeplog_adapter.py` (`deeplog`) and `test_deepproblog_standalone.py` (`deepproblog`), both in the `backends` extra, and `test_problog_kbest.py` (`problog`), in the `oracles` extra. These are the `/ 3 skipped` in pytest's collection header, not part of the 107 collected items.

cd reasonsmith && ruff check . && python -m pytest -q -rA
```

`ruff check .`: **All checks passed!**

`pytest`: **35 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped** — the progress line and the `-rA` report that command printed, verbatim. This is the v0.1 suite at the measured commit and is not the current count; see "What the `35 passed` figure does and does not count" above.

## 3. `python -m reasonsmith.demo`, Twice, Diffed

```sh
python -m reasonsmith.demo > run1.txt
python -m reasonsmith.demo > run2.txt
diff run1.txt run2.txt          # empty
md5sum run1.txt run2.txt        # c5976971e24a86886f1e0ad54f0b9ce9 for both
```

**The two runs are byte-identical: `diff` produces no output, both files hash to `c5976971e24a86886f1e0ad54f0b9ce9`.** `demo.py`'s docstring claim that every figure and transcript line "can be verified and diffed byte-for-byte" holds, measured, not assumed. That hash is this commit's demo; for the hash the same two commands produce once the contributed sections 6–9 are present, see the Contributor Demos Note.

### Empirical Details of Key Finding Figures

From the credit demonstration (ECOA/Reg B, Table 7 row 4), decision `APP-1042`:

- **Exact inference** (bounded proof enumeration + exact WMC) finds **5 reasons**.
- The **deployed top-1 engine** uses **1** of them.
- **4 of the 5 are deleted** — named individually (C02–C05), each with the exact-inference probability mass it carries (0.019804, 0.005262, 0.004166, 0.008995) and confirmation that deleting each one's fact leaves the engine's output unchanged.
- The Table 7 evidence record for the decision is emitted as **`EVIDENCE RECORD [COMPLETE]`** — all 5 required fields are present.
- The paired reason-deletion certificate for the decision is **`REASON-DELETION CERTIFICATE [FAIL]`** — exact value 0.991399, engine value 0.765600, gap −0.225799 (tolerance 1e-9).

The same pattern reproduces on the clinical demonstration (GDPR Art. 22, Table 7 row 3, decision `PT-0731`): 5 reasons found, 1 used, 4 deleted, record `COMPLETE`, certificate `FAIL` (exact 0.991424 vs. engine 0.731000, gap −0.260424).

### Conformance / Table 19 Figures

#### Design A — Confidence Varies, Reason Structure Fixed

| Group | n | Measured | Reasons Found | Reasons Used | Reasons Deleted | Coverage | Fidelity | Retained Share | Diversity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **typical** | 4 | 4 | 3.0000 | 1.0000 | 2.0000 | 0.3333 | 0.7807 | 0.7731 | 0.3333 |
| **atypical** | 4 | 4 | 3.0000 | 1.0000 | 2.0000 | 0.3333 | 0.7272 | 0.4929 | 0.3333 |

Gaps (best group minus worst):
- `fidelity`: **+0.0535** (best typical, worst atypical)
- `retained_share`: **+0.2802** (best typical, worst atypical)
- `coverage`: **+0.0000** (no gap)

#### Design B — Reason Multiplicity Varies, Confidence Fixed

| Group | n | Measured | Reasons Found | Reasons Used | Reasons Deleted | Coverage | Fidelity | Retained Share | Diversity |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **typical** | 4 | 4 | 2.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 0.5000 | 0.7831 | 0.7292 | 0.5000 |
| **atypical** | 4 | 4 | 5.0000 | 1.0000 | 4.0000 | 0.2000 | 0.6360 | 0.6163 | 0.2000 |

Gaps (best group minus worst):
- `fidelity`: **+0.1472** (best typical, worst atypical)
- `retained_share`: **+0.1129** (best typical, worst atypical)
- `coverage`: **+0.3000** (best typical, worst atypical)

#### Registered Hypothesis Outcome

- **Confidence Form (Design A):** NOT supported (coverage gap 0.0000 — top-k keeps a fixed proof count regardless of confidence scaling).
- **Multiplicity Form (Design B):** Supported (coverage gap 0.3000 — a case tripping 5 reasons and told 1 keeps 1/5th; a case tripping 2 keeps 1/2).

### Stability Across Windows

One unchanged applicant file, four windows, a strengthening delinquency signal: the top-1 stated reason changes from `C01` (windows 0–1) to `C03` (windows 2–3). **Stability across the four windows: 0.3333** (1.0 would mean the same reason every window).

### Full Transcript Provenance

The complete, unedited output of both demo runs (identical to each other) was 561 lines at the measured commit. Regenerate that transcript with `python -m reasonsmith.demo` from commit `9411ca60a70c0d4f72f12a038e01d9d65c70c03f`. The transcript committed in [`docs/example-output.md`](docs/example-output.md) is no longer that one — it is the longer run recorded in the Contributor Demos Note below.

**Re-checked after repin to nesyarena `57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7` and update to PyPI release `nesyarena==0.1.0` (2026-07-31):** `python -m reasonsmith.demo`, run twice against PyPI `nesyarena==0.1.0`, still produces the same 561 identical lines (`md5sum` `c5976971e24a86886f1e0ad54f0b9ce9`), `pytest` reports 189 passed (35 passed on v0.1 suite), and `ruff check .` reports no findings.

### Contributor Demos Note (2026-08-01)

Four Table 7 demos contributed by Alessandro Boni — EU AI Act Art. 13 (row 1), EU AI Act Art. 12 (row 2), FDA GMLP for SaMD (row 5), and NIST AI RMF continuous monitoring (row 6) — landed on branch `fm/rs-land-contributor-demos`, appending sections 6–9 to `python -m reasonsmith.demo`. Sections 1–5 are byte-identical to the 561-line transcript above, so every figure this file reports for them stands unre-measured and unchanged.

What was measured on this branch, at commit `8b4c72042443dfdb116c851d67f6dc3884392665`, in the same venv against PyPI `nesyarena==0.1.0`:

- `python -m reasonsmith.demo`, run twice: **909 lines**, byte-identical, `md5sum` `259fb66c4ebe4ce5c4b136c0e947f4cb`. This is the transcript committed in [`docs/example-output.md`](docs/example-output.md), and the pair of numbers `tests/test_docs_example_output.py` checks that file's header against.
- `pytest`: **226 passed**. That is the whole current suite (`test_docs_example_output.py` 1, `test_html_report.py` 15, `test_reasonsmith.py` 47, `test_v02_core.py` 93, `test_v02_stage2.py` 45, `test_v02_stage3.py` 25), not the v0.1 suite the `35 passed` row counts, and it supersedes the `189 passed` in the PyPI Release Note as the current-suite figure.

Nothing else in this file was re-measured on this branch. Section 1 (`nesyarena`'s own suite) and every Table 19 conformance figure remain the 2026-07-31 measurements at `reasonsmith` commit `9411ca60a70c0d4f72f12a038e01d9d65c70c03f`, and the four new sections add no figure to them.

## What Changed From Prior Torch Caveats

The README used to say `torch` was never installed and that, without it, "98 tests pass while `tests/test_e6_findings.py` and `tests/test_learning_parity.py` fail to collect". That caveat is now replaced by the measured numbers above: torch is installed in the environment used to produce this file, both named modules collect and run, and pytest collects 107 items (plus 3 modules skipped at collection time), not 98.

Two nesyarena tests still cannot pass here — not for lack of torch, but for lack of `ltn` (LTNtorch) and `problog`, which live behind nesyarena's separate `backends` and `oracles` extras and were out of scope for this task. `torch` remains outside reasonsmith's own declared dependencies (`pyproject.toml` is unchanged); it was installed only in the separate environment used to measure nesyarena's suite here.

## Pack Analysis Note (2026-08-04)

`reasonsmith validate-pack <pack> --analyse` reads a pack as a set of formulas rather than as a
checklist to run a system against (`src/reasonsmith/analysis.py`, `docs/semantics.md` §8). The
figures below were measured on branch `fm/rs-w0-pack-analysis` with the commands quoted, in the
same environment as the section above (`pip install -e ".[dev]"`, `nesyarena==0.1.0`, no torch).
They name **no commit**, for the reason [`docs/report.html`](docs/report.html) names none: the
commit carrying this section does not exist while the section is written, and a hash put here would
name a different one. What makes them reconstructible is the command, which a reader can run.

### Equivalence, found without a human reading either TOML block

```sh
reasonsmith validate-pack eu_ai_act --analyse
```

```text
  equivalent: eu_ai_act_art12_1_automatic_logging <=> eu_ai_act_art12_2_traceability_monitoring
```

That overlap was recorded in prose in [`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md) after a human read
the two `[[requirement]]` blocks. It is now a finding the tool reaches on its own. All five shipped
packs report their requirement sets **jointly satisfiable**, and none is vacuous on its own
formulas — over the unconstrained signal model only a tautology would be, which is what keeps the
pack-only rendering free of false alarms.

### Mutation score per duty — symbolic rule set, ECOA and GDPR

```sh
reasonsmith validate-pack ecoa --analyse \
  --system-module reasonsmith.examples.symbolic_rules:system_under_test
reasonsmith validate-pack gdpr --analyse \
  --system-module reasonsmith.examples.symbolic_rules:system_under_test
```

Domain: **30 single-point mutants** of the system's **14 declared rules** — one comparison, boolean
connective, number or recorded statement changed per mutant. A duty "detects" a mutant when its
verdict or its strength differs from the same duty's against the unmutated rules.

| Duty | Detected | Score |
|---|---|---|
| `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_a_2_written_statement` | 5 / 30 | 0.17 |
| `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_b_2_specific_reasons` | 2 / 30 | 0.07 |
| `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_a_1_timing_of_notice` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |
| `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_b_2_principal_reasons_complete` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |
| `ecoa_reg_b_1002_4_a_no_disparate_treatment` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |
| `gdpr_recital71_error_risk_minimised` | 6 / 30 | 0.20 |
| `gdpr_art22_3_safeguards_human_intervention` | 3 / 30 | 0.10 |
| `gdpr_art22_1_automated_decision_prohibition` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |
| `gdpr_art22_1_no_prohibited_decision_for_any_input` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |
| `gdpr_recital71_meaningful_explanation` | 0 / 30 | 0.00 |

**This is not a coverage number, and must not be read as one.** Two limits travel with it, printed
by the tool itself as `analysis.MUTATION_LIMIT`:

- Mutation analysis reaches **only a system that exposes its decision logic as a rule block**
  through `sut.logic()`, which is not most audited systems. Of the systems this repository ships,
  one qualifies: the neural scorer, the probabilistic scorer and the language model have nothing to
  mutate, and every duty gets *no score at all* rather than a low one. A number covering one system
  of four says nothing about the fourteen duties the other three are checked against.
- Where it does run, the score is sensitivity to **these thirty mutants** and to no others. It does
  not measure how much of a system a duty covers, and a duty scoring 1.0 would not thereby be a
  good duty.

Read that way, the numbers put a figure on what [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) §4 states in words —
twenty-one of the twenty-eight shipped requirements were presence checks when this was measured.
Six of the ten duties above
cannot tell any of thirty rule sets apart. Five of those six are inert for a reason the report
already gives without mutating anything (a signal the system has no notion of, an undeclared
regulatory class, a counterfactual the system exposes no protected variable for), which is the
verdict working rather than the duty failing. The sixth, `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_a_1_timing_of_notice`,
is `proved` satisfied against every one of the thirty — and the vacuity check names why on the same
run: the system's own seven-day batch window bounds every notice below thirty days, so the clause's
ninety-day counteroffer branch is replaceable by any formula and the duty is settled before any
rule the mutants touch is read.

### Suite after this change

```sh
pytest -q && ruff check .
```

**681 passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped; `ruff check .` reports no findings. The count includes the 14
tests of `tests/test_pack_analysis.py`, and supersedes the `226 passed` of the note above as the
current-suite figure.

### Temporal duties, decided as finite-trace formulas (2026-08-04)

```sh
pip install "reasonsmith[ltlf]"
reasonsmith validate-pack ecoa --analyse
```

```text
  temporal: 3 temporal dut(ies) decided as finite-trace formulas, each satisfiable by some non-empty finite trace
  temporal entailment: 3 of 3 pair(s) not decided either way — together they carry more propositional atoms than the installed decision procedure builds an automaton for in bounded time (reasonsmith.ltlf.ATOM_BUDGET)
```

The four shipped `temporal` requirements — three in `ecoa`, one in `gdpr` — are each decided
satisfiable by some non-empty finite trace, `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_c_2_incompleteness_notice_runs_out`
included. Before this it appeared in `--analyse` only as a reason string saying it had not been
reduced, because the Z3 questions decide one decision record and `until` is not a property of one.

The entailment line is the honest half of the same measurement, and it is a limit of the installed
procedure and not of the pack. `flloat` enumerates the powerset of a formula's atoms as its
automaton's alphabet: measured on this tree, a pack-shaped question costs about 2 s at four atoms,
9 s at five and more than 90 s at six. Every shipped temporal duty is three or four atoms and is
answered in under a second; every *pair* of them is seven, so all three ECOA pairs are reported
**not decided either way** rather than cleared. `reasonsmith.ltlf.ATOM_BUDGET` is checked before the
automaton is built, because there is no wall clock anywhere in this package. Read
[`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §8 before quoting any of this: the reading is
propositional, so satisfiability is reported only in the affirmative and an entailment it does not
report is not a distinction any system can make.

```sh
pytest -q && ruff check .
```

**738 passed**, 0 failed, 0 skipped; `ruff check .` reports no findings, with the `ltlf` extra
installed. The count includes the 29 tests of `tests/test_ltlf_backend.py` and supersedes the
`681 passed` above as the current-suite figure. With the extra *absent* the analysis reports it and
that module's tests skip, which is the arrangement `pip install reasonsmith` has to keep working.
