"""Conformance report skeleton and unattainable analysis for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Constructs `ConformanceReport` instances carrying per-requirement verdicts, strengths, source
  clauses, required/missing signals, and headline summaries. Evaluates `check_conformance` and
  static `analyze_unattainable`.

What a reader must not break:
  - No result claims a strength it did not earn (`strength` is `None` when un-evaluated).
    Why this matters: A requirement never evaluated (e.g. unsupported formalism or empty trace)
    is recorded as un-evaluated, never quietly counted as satisfied or given an unearned strength.
  - `_engine_ladder` decides which engines may discharge a requirement from two things: the
    fragment its property belongs to, and what the system under test exposes. `evaluate_requirement`
    then takes the strongest evidence any of them produced, falling to the next rung when an engine
    established nothing.
    Why this matters: `formalism` used to name the property *and* pick the engine, so 17 of 18
    shipped duties could never exceed `observed` however much a system exposed — a fact about a
    word in a TOML file, reported as a fact about the system. Which rung a duty reaches must be a
    fact about the system. What a verdict *means* is untouched by this: see `docs/semantics.md`
    §3.5, including the case where exposed logic and trace disagree. One duty has a single-rung
    ladder, for the opposite reason: a weaker rung on a reason-adequacy duty would answer a
    *different* property off the system's own log — see `_engine_ladder`.
  - Combining zero verdicts is `inconclusive`, never vacuously `satisfied`.
    Why this matters: Having checked nothing is not evidence that a requirement holds.
  - The unattainable analysis must NEVER execute the system (`sut.decisions()` is never called).
    Why this matters: Static capability checking acts as a pre-execution safety gate using set
    differences over declared signal names before running decision traces.
  - Every emitted report carries explicit limits on its scope and guarantees.
    Why this matters: Reports assess technical trace evidence against specifications, not legal
    counsel.

    "requirement is limited to; or no decision domain was declared for the system at all, or "
    "none of the domains that were declared is one the requirement is about. This tool infers "

#: Formalisms this build can actually evaluate. `undetermined` and `graded` are on this list and

#: Where a result records that the duty rests on an open-textured predicate no engine here settles,

OPEN_TEXTURE_KEY = "open_texture"

#: The fields that key carries, per atom. Named here for the reason `PROBE_BUDGET_FIELDS` is: a
#: rendering asks the result rather than parsing a sentence that is free to be reworded.
OPEN_TEXTURE_FIELDS = ("signal", "predicate", "authority")

#: Where a result carries a truth degree measured over a declared algebra against a declared
#: grading. Everything about this key is a refusal in the shape of a data structure, and
#: `RequirementResult._validate_truth_degree` is where each one bites:
#:
#: - the degree may not travel without `algebra` and without all of `DEGREE_SOURCE_FIELDS`, which is
#:   constraint B of this design — a degree with no account of who fixed the scale is a figure;
#: - a result carrying one may not carry a strength, because a truth degree is a **distinct evidence
#:   basis and not a rescaled verdict**: nothing here turns `0.7` into seventy percent of a verdict,
#:   and no rung of the lattice means "graded".
TRUTH_DEGREE_KEY = "truth_degree"

#: The fields that key carries. `atoms` is every graded atom's own degree, so a reader sees what the
#: algebra combined rather than only what it produced.
TRUTH_DEGREE_FIELDS = ("degree", "algebra", "atoms", "source")

#: Where a probed result carries the search that produced it, and the fields that search must
#: name. A probed verdict is a statement about a bounded search — how many inputs were replayed,
#: how they were generated and from which seed — so a result that does not carry them cannot be
#: constructed at all (see `RequirementResult.__post_init__`), rather than being rendered without
#: them and read as if the property had been established for every input.
PROBE_BUDGET_KEY = "probe_budget"
PROBE_BUDGET_FIELDS = ("trials", "strategy", "seed", "input_space")
_UNREAD = object()

#: Where a not-applicable result records that the *system* said nothing, rather than that it said
#: something else. The two are not the same finding: a declared domain that does not meet the
#: duty's is an answer, while an undeclared one is a missing input, and a run that skipped duties
#: for a missing input must not read like a run that checked them. Carried as a flag rather than
#: left to be recovered from the reason prose, so every rendering asks the result rather than
#: parsing a sentence that is free to be reworded.
UNDECLARED_DOMAIN_KEY = "skipped_for_undeclared_domain"

#: Where a result produced by an installed engine plug-in records which plug-in produced it and
#: what ceiling that plug-in declared. Both halves are load-bearing. The name is provenance: a
#: reader of a verdict must be able to see that a third-party engine answered, and this package
#: refuses an invisible provenance everywhere else. The ceiling is the claim the plug-in made
#: about itself, and `__post_init__` refuses a result carrying a strength above it — an engine
#: declaring `probed` and returning `proved` has its result refused rather than trusted. See
#: `reasonsmith.plugins` and `docs/authoring-engines.md`.
ENGINE_PLUGIN_KEY = "engine_plugin"

#: Where the certificate engine records one entry per decision it certified. Named here rather
#: than spelled twice because a rendering reads it: a reader who is shown "the reasons stated were
#: not all the reasons" is being shown this measurement and nothing else.
CERTIFICATES_KEY = "certificates"

#: Where a result measured against an inference artefact records whether the reason set it was
#: measured against was *enumerated* from a model encoding or *recounted* by the system. False caps
#: the result at `Strength.RECOUNTED`, and `__post_init__` refuses one that claims higher — the
#: structural form of the rule `docs/semantics.md` §3 used to state in prose and gate a second
#: artefact family on. See `artifacts.RECOUNTED_REASONS`.
EXACT_REASON_SET_KEY = "reason_set_is_exact"

#: The version of the `--json` envelope's *shape*, carried as `schema_version` on every
#: `ConformanceReport.to_dict()`. It is a single integer and it is not the package version:
#: a consumer reads it to know which keys to expect, and pinning it to `__version__` would make
#: every release look like a shape change. The convention, stated in README, "The CLI", is that
#: it increments when an existing key is **removed, renamed, or changes type or meaning** —
#: anything a parser written against the previous number could get wrong — and does **not**
#: increment when a key is added, because a consumer reading known keys is unaffected.
#: `tests/test_json_schema_version.py` pins the key set at each level to this number, so a
#: change to the shape fails the suite until this number moves with it.
#:
#: Version 2 adds `time_domain` and is a bump under that rule rather than in spite of it: adding
#: the key is not what moved the number, the *meaning* of every temporal verdict in the envelope
#: did. Under version 1 a bound in a temporal `spec` counted records, and that a reader had to
#: know from `docs/semantics.md` §2 rather than from the document in front of them. Version 2
#: states the clock the run was answered on, so a parser can tell a verdict counted in decisions
#: from one counted on any later domain instead of assuming the first.
JSON_SCHEMA_VERSION = 2

#: The two signals a decision record is read for when a report is asked what the system itself
#: said about a decision: what it recorded as the decision, and what it stated as the reason.
#:
#: Naming two pack signals here is a real coupling and is deliberate. It is the same coupling
#: `engines/certificate.py` already carries for `artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count`, and it buys
#: the one thing a lay rendering cannot do without: the system's own words. Anything wider — a
#: rendering that guessed which of a record's fields is "the reason" — would be this package
#: inventing an explanation, which is the line `docs/semantics.md` §7 refuses to cross.
DECISION_RECORD_SIGNAL = "artifact_logs_decision_record"
REASON_SIGNAL = "artifact_logs_reason_explanation"


#: Re-exported so the engines and the JSONL adapter keep importing presence from one place. The
#: definition lives in `rulelang` because `present(signal)` is an atom of the property language
#: and the interpreter has to answer it; having two definitions of "present" is how the record
#: engine and a `present()` atom would come to disagree about the same record.

class RequirementResult:
    """The conformance result for a single requirement.

    `strength` is `None` when the requirement was not evaluated at all or is not applicable;
    see the module docstring. `signals_missing` names required signals missing from the
    adapter's capability set and is therefore populated only on an unattainable result. Signals
    in that set but absent from a particular trace are a different finding and land in
    `details`.

    `binding` records whether the duty is a legally binding obligation (true) or an
    interpretive recital/guidance item (false), `scope` records any regulatory class the
    duty is limited to (e.g. 'high-risk'), and `domains` records the kinds of decision it is
    about (e.g. 'consumer-credit'), empty meaning it is not domain-limited. All three are
    carried through from the requirement so a reader of a single result never has to go back to
    the pack to know what kind of duty it is.

    `basis` is the fourth such fact and the second coordinate of the evidence claim: what kind of
    thing this duty's evidence is *about*, as against `strength`, which says how far the claim was
    pushed. It is derived from the requirement by `evidence_basis` and stamped once by
    `evaluate_requirement`, never authored in a pack and never declared by a system; the default
    here is the behavioural basis because that is what a direct construction is — evidence about
    the system's own executions — and the stamp is what makes a non-behavioural duty carry the
    truth. A result may not carry a strength its basis does not admit
    (`verdict.BASIS_RUNGS`): a counterfactual duty cannot be reported `observed` and a certificate
    duty cannot be reported `proved`, and those are refusals rather than conventions.

      anything measured from the system — the `assessment` basis, no rung at all.

    decision the system is not declared to make, does not reach this system, and the result is
    NOT_APPLICABLE with no strength, because nothing about the system was checked. Neither the
    class nor the domain is ever inferred — an undeclared system is not silently treated as in
    scope, and the result says which of the two it was. A declared class outside
    `REGULATORY_CLASSES`, or a domain outside `DECISION_DOMAINS`, is refused rather than
    answered, here as well as in `check_conformance`, so a caller reaching this function
    directly gets the same guarantee.

    If the adapter's capability set does not cover the required signals, returns UNATTAINABLE
    without executing the SUT. Otherwise `records` is used as the decision trace; when it is
    None the trace is fetched from the SUT, so callers holding a trace already can avoid
    re-running the system once per requirement.

    Two things decide the list, and `formalism` is only one of them. The fragment says what kind
    of property this is — a state property of one decision record, or a temporal one reaching
    across records — and the system's exposed surface says what can be reasoned over. A presence
    property checked against a trace is `observed`; the *same* property discharged against exposed
    `logic()` is `proved`. Which rung a duty reaches is therefore a fact about the system, not
    about which word a pack author typed.

    Building the ladder never *executes* the system: both optional rungs are selected from the
    callable surface alone, `logic` exactly as `decide` already was. Calling `logic()` here to
    decide whether the proof rung belongs would let a system whose `logic()` raises abort a duty
    the record engine could have answered from its trace.

    **Every state fragment admits a trace rung, `logical` included.** A `logical` property is a
    property of one decision record — that is what puts it in `STATE_FRAGMENTS` — so a trace of
    decision records is evidence about it, and a build that refused to read one reported *not
    evaluated* while the evidence sat in front of it. That was a defect, not a policy: the label
    on the fragment was deciding what could be checked, which is the thing fragment classification
    was introduced to stop. Which engine reads the trace still depends on the shape: a presence
    conjunction keeps the record engine and its per-signal, per-record diagnostics, and every other
    state formula is monitored per record by `ObservedEngine`, whose rtamt monitor scores a
    non-temporal formula pointwise and names the record positions that breached.

    **A temporal duty reaches the proof rung only in the one shape that reduces to a state
    property.** `always(f)`, over a finite trace, holds exactly when `f` holds at every position,
    and every position is a decision the exposed logic produces — so `engines.temporal`'s reduction
    hands the solver a property about one decision, which is the only kind it can answer. Every
    other temporal shape stops at `observed` as it always did, because a solver reasoning about one
    decision at a time still has nothing to say about it, and inventing a rung for one would be the
    overclaim this package exists to refuse. The rung is selected from the *shape of the spec* as
    well as from the exposed surface, which is why `state_property_under_always` is consulted here:
    appending a rung that will always report not-evaluated would make every non-`always` temporal
    duty pay for a solver call that cannot answer it.

    **The `counterfactual` fragment has no trace rung, and returns before every other rung is
    considered.** `counterfactually_invariant(outcome, protected)` is a property of a *pair* of
    executions: hold every input fixed, move one named variable, and the decision must not move. A
    trace holds what the system decided and a counterfactual asks what it would have decided, so no
    length of decision log establishes one — reading the atom off a record is refused by
    `rulelang.eval_expression` itself, which is why this is a fact about the code rather than a
    convention this function is trusted to keep. Two rungs remain, both of which *run* the system:
    the solver encoding the declared rules twice, and the paired replay running `decide()` on a
    recorded decision and on its twin. Neither is appended alongside a plug-in rung, for the reason
    the certificate duty below returns early: an installed package this repository never audited
    must not be able to answer a counterfactual duty off a log either.

    One duty is deliberately given a ladder of **one** rung: a duty gating on
    `engines.certificate.DELETED_REASON_COUNT` asks whether the reasons a decision states are all
    the reasons its inference had, and that is measured against the inference artefact or not at
    all. Every other rung here would answer a weaker question off the system's own log — that the
    reason field is non-blank, or that the number the system wrote in it is small — and reporting
    either in place of the measurement is the substitution the certificate engine exists to
    remove. A system exposing no artefact is therefore reported *unattainable* by that engine
    rather than falling through to a presence check. That single rung stays single: the plug-in
    rungs below are appended after it has already returned, so no installed package can answer that
    duty off the system's log either.

    Engines an installed package supplies (entry-point group `reasonsmith.engines`) join the ladder
    at the ceiling each declares, which is exactly what makes "a new engine is reached the moment it
    exists" mean *installed* rather than *in this tree*. What a plug-in may claim, and what happens
    when one misbehaves, is `reasonsmith.plugins` and `docs/authoring-engines.md`.
