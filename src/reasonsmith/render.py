"""Rendering of a `ConformanceReport` into plain text and self-contained HTML.

What this module is for:
  The two renderings of a conformance report, moved out of `report.py` so the report type,
  the result type and the evaluation machinery are not half of a thousand-line method:
  `render_text` is the readable console rendering, and `render_html` is the self-contained,
  offline, A4-printable HTML page. The `ConformanceReport` methods of the same names delegate
  here, so the public API is unchanged.

What a reader must not break:
  - These are pure renders of the report they are handed: they compute nothing about the
    system and print nothing the report does not carry. `render_html`'s provenance bar is the
    one deliberate exception, and it states only the caller's own `commit_hash`/`command`
    arguments or what the checkout this module was imported from can attest (`_source_checkout`)
    — never a guess.
  - Every rendering is a witness, not a summary that may round: probe budgets, elided witness
    rows and skipped duties are printed with the numbers they had, and a requirement without a
    strength renders as not evaluated, never as satisfied. A rendering that must not be read as
    complete carries its own limit in the same breath.
  - An audience projection (`AudienceProjection`, `AUDIENCES`) decides *what is shown*, never
    what is claimed. Three properties of it are load-bearing and are asserted in
    `tests/test_audience_view.py`: no audience sees a verdict another audience does not see, no
    audience loses `report.limits`, and the affected-individual projection carries no system
    internals. `audience=None` is the full report and is byte-identical to the rendering that
    existed before projections did — every generated document in `docs/` is pinned to it.

        Zero external dependencies, network-free, printable on A4. Presents the
        evidence strength lattice, counts split by binding vs interpretive,
        and visually distinguishes unattainable architectural gaps from violated trace failures.

        The provenance bar states what can be established and nothing more. `commit_hash`
        left `None` means "work it out": the commit is named only when the checkout this
        package was imported from is clean (see `_source_checkout`), and a modified or
        unidentifiable checkout is reported as such rather than given a hash it would not
        reproduce. Passing an empty `commit_hash` asserts no commit identifies this report,
        which is what a report committed into the tree it describes must say. `command` is
        never guessed: an unsupplied command is left out, because a command line the report
        invented is not provenance.

        `extra_section_html` is inserted verbatim below the headline and is empty unless a
        caller supplies it. Nothing derived from anything but this report's own results may be
        rendered by default: a narrative about another system's decision, sitting inside a
        document handed to an auditor, is exactly the false completeness this package refuses.
        The caller that passes it owns the claim it makes and escapes its own content.

        `provenance_note` is one sentence appended to the provenance bar, escaped, and is empty
        unless a caller supplies it. It exists for the caller that can establish something about
        this report's origin that this module cannot: a page committed into the repository it
        describes can never name the commit that carries it — that commit does not exist when the
        page is rendered — but it can name the check that holds it to its command. The claim
        belongs to the caller for the same reason `extra_section_html` does. Nothing is guessed
        here and nothing is defaulted: a report whose caller says nothing says nothing.

        `audience` selects an `AudienceProjection` exactly as it does for `render_text`: it
        narrows which parts of this report are drawn and changes no verdict. `None` is the full
        page, unchanged, which is what every generated document under `docs/` is pinned to.

       not worth keeping, so the badge group drops to its own line before anything collides.
