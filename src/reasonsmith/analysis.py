"""Analysis of a requirement pack as a set of formulas, rather than of one system's evidence.

What this module is for:
  `check` asks what a system's evidence says about a duty. This module asks four questions about
  the duties themselves, none of which any other code path can answer:

  - **Satisfiability.** Is a pack's requirement set jointly satisfiable — is there any decision
    record at all that discharges every duty in it at once? A pack whose duties contradict each
    other reports every system violated for a reason that is the pack's and not the system's.
  - **Subsumption and equivalence.** Does one requirement's property entail another's? Two
    byte-identical properties cannot come apart in any report, and until now that was found by a
    human reading TOML and written into prose (`docs/refinement.md`, EU AI Act Article 12(2)).
  - **Vacuity.** Is a duty discharged without its own content doing any work — Kupferman and
    Vardi's question, restricted to the fragments this repository ships. `docs/semantics.md` §8
    states the definition and what it costs; the existing
    `report.not_evaluated_for_unreachable_trigger` is the special case where the replaceable
    subformula is an implication's consequent, and the acceptance test
    `test_vacuity_coincides_with_the_unreachable_trigger_rule` holds the two together.
  - **Coverage.** Mutate a system's exposed `logic()`, re-run the pack, and record which duties
    notice. A duty no mutant moves has no discriminating power against these mutants.

What a reader must not break:
  - The Z3 encoding is `engines/proved.py`'s, reached through `_ast_to_z3` and `_Scope`, and there
    is no second one here. `_PackScope` overrides exactly two methods — the two atoms whose meaning
    genuinely differs when there is no system to assign anything — and every connective,
    comparison and arithmetic operator stays the engine's.
    Why this matters: a second encoding that disagrees with the first is the defect this
    repository already guards against between the solver and the interpreter for `contains()`. An
    analysis that reasons about a formula the engines do not implement reports findings about a
    pack nobody runs.
  - A question the encoding cannot reach is **skipped by name**, never answered. The
    `counterfactual` fragment is a property of a pair of executions and is not encoded here at
    all; a temporal spec that is not `always(state property)` is not reduced *by the Z3 encoding*.
    Why this matters: a silent omission reads as "nothing found", which is the overclaim this
    package exists to refuse. Every skip travels in `PackAnalysis.skipped`.
  - The temporal fragment is decided **as a formula of a finite-trace logic**, by `ltlf.py`, and
    that is a second decision procedure over a second abstraction rather than a widening of the
    first. Z3 keeps every magnitude and decides one record; LTLf keeps every position and abstracts
    every magnitude to an opaque atom. Neither subsumes the other, `LTLF_ABSTRACTION_LIMIT` says so
    on the answers that rest on it, and the backend is an **optional extra** whose absence is a
    note and never a weaker answer wearing the same words.
    Why this matters: before it, `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_c_2_incompleteness_notice_runs_out` — a shipped
    binding duty written with `until` — was skipped by every question this module asks.
  - The mutation score is **not a coverage claim**, and `MUTATION_LIMIT` says so on the analysis
    that carries one. It reaches only a system that exposes `logic()` as a rule block, which is
    not most audited systems, and it measures sensitivity to *these* mutants and to no others.
    Why this matters: a number rendered beside a pack invites being read as the pack's quality.
    What it measures is whether a duty can tell two rule sets apart.
