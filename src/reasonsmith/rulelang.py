"""Shared rule and specification mini-language for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Rule text and requirement specs arrive as strings from pack TOML files and from adapter
  constructors. This module is the one place that parses, rewrites and executes that text, so the
  Z3 encoding in `engines/proved.py` and the reference interpreter in `adapters/rules.py` agree on
  exactly which constructs exist.

  It is also the one property language every requirement's `spec` is written in. A `spec` used to
  mean two unrelated things — a formula for `temporal` and `logical`, free English prose for
  `record` that no engine read — so a reader met prose and an STL formula in the same field.
  `classify_fragment` names which fragment of this one language a spec belongs to, the pack loader
  refuses a spec whose fragment is not the one the pack declared, and the English moved to the
  `rationale` field, which means prose. What a requirement *says* is now separate from what
  evidence discharges it: see `report.evaluate_requirement`, which searches for the strongest
  engine the fragment and the system's exposed surface allow.

What a reader must not break:
  - Nothing here may call `eval`, `exec` or `compile`. Pack files are data supplied by third
    parties; a pack that can run arbitrary Python is a pack that can do anything the user can.
    Why this matters: `{"__builtins__": ...}` is not a sandbox — `().__class__.__base__` walks out
    of it — so the whitelist has to be the interpreter itself, not the name table handed to one.
  - Every construct this module refuses must raise `UnsupportedConstructError`, never be skipped.
    Why this matters: a silently dropped statement makes the solver prove a property about logic
    the author did not write, which is reported as `proved` and is therefore an overclaim.
  - The set of constructs accepted here and the set encoded in `engines/proved.py` must stay the
    same set.
    Why this matters: counterexample verification runs the interpreter against the solver's model.
    If one side models a statement the other drops, verification agrees with itself about the
    wrong program.
  - `classify_fragment` names the *narrowest* fragment a spec belongs to, and the loader demands
    an exact match rather than a compatible one. A presence conjunction is also a well-formed
    `logical` property, so a lenient check would let one be declared `logical` and lose the record
    engine's per-signal, per-record diagnostics for nothing.
    Why this matters: the fragment is what decides which engines may discharge the duty. A
    fragment nobody checks is the silent downgrade this field was introduced to end.

_IMPLICATION_TOKENS = ("=>", "->", " implies ")

#: The atom asking whether a decision record carries a value for a signal at all.
PRESENCE_CALL = "present"

#: The atom asking whether a signal's recorded text carries a given phrase.
#:
#: `contains(signal, "phrase")` is the second — and, at the time of writing, only other — atom whose
#: first argument is a signal *name* rather than an expression, for the same reason `present()` is:
#: every engine has to bind it to one field of one decision record, and there is no such field
#: behind a computed value. Its second argument is a string literal and never a name, so the phrase
#: a duty forbids is fixed by the pack rather than supplied by the system being audited.
#:
#: It exists because fifteen of the eighteen shipped duties were conjunctions of `present()`, which
#: made the strongest claim available about an explanation duty "the field is non-blank" — a reason
#: string of `"n/a"` satisfies that and violates 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2). The clause supplies its own
#: negative constraint, naming the statements that are insufficient, and this atom is the narrowest
#: thing that expresses one. It deliberately does not model "specific": it answers whether a phrase
#: occurs, and nothing about what the text means.
CONTAINS_CALL = "contains"

#: The atom asking whether one named variable can move a named outcome, holding everything else
#: fixed — `counterfactually_invariant(outcome_signal, protected_signal)`.
#:
#: It is the third atom whose arguments are signal *names* rather than expressions, for the reason
#: the other two give: every engine has to bind them to named variables, and there is no variable
#: behind a computed value. It is the first atom in this language that is **not a property of one
#: decision record**. `present()` and `contains()` ask something about a decision; this asks whether
#: two decisions the system would make — differing in one input and in nothing else — agree. That
#: is a property of a *pair* of executions, which is why it has a fragment of its own
#: (`classify_fragment`) rather than being admitted into `logical`: a trace holds what happened and
#: a counterfactual is about what would have happened, so no engine reading a trace may be handed
#: this. `report._engine_ladder` gives the fragment no trace rung, and `eval_expression` refuses the
#: atom outright so that nothing can evaluate one against a decision record by accident.
#:
#: The admissible values of the protected variable come from the system's declared `constraints`,
#: never from the trace. See `engines/counterfactual.py` and `docs/semantics.md` §3.
COUNTERFACTUAL_CALL = "counterfactually_invariant"

#: The atom for a predicate the law states in words with no sharp boundary, which **no engine here
#: settles** — `undetermined(signal, "predicate", "authority")`.
#:
#: It is the fourth atom whose first argument is a signal *name* rather than an expression, and it
#: exists because the fourth column of `docs/refinement.md` says the same thing over and over:
#: *meaningful*, *sufficiently detailed*, *adequate*, *appropriate* were not modelled, and a
#: presence check stood in for each. Roughly three quarters of that already happened incidentally,
#: through whichever not-evaluated path a duty happened to fall down. This makes it a construct: the
#: pack states, in the property itself, which predicate is open-textured and **which authority would
#: settle it** — a supervisory authority, a court, a published guideline — and the result names
#: both. It is never silently true and never silently false.
#:
#: The signal argument is load-bearing and is not decoration. It is what puts the name into
#: `requires`, so a system that cannot emit the thing the predicate is about is reported
#: `unattainable` by the capability gate before this atom is ever reached. An undetermined duty is
#: therefore not a way for every system to get the same answer.
UNDETERMINED_CALL = "undetermined"

#: The atom whose value is a **truth degree** rather than a truth value —
#: `degree(signal, "predicate")`.
#:
#: The other half of the same problem, and a different half. `undetermined()` is the conservative
#: reading: the predicate is not settled here, so nothing is claimed. But vagueness is not missing
#: information — *sufficiently detailed* has no sharp boundary even when every fact is known, which
#: is what many-valued logic exists for. This atom's degree comes from a declared source outside the
#: system (`manyvalued.Grading`), and the connectives above it are read over an algebra the pack
#: declares (`manyvalued.ALGEBRAS`). Neither is optional and neither has a default.
#:
#: Nothing here turns a degree into a verdict. See `manyvalued` and `docs/semantics.md` §9.
DEGREE_CALL = "degree"

#: Every atom whose first argument is a signal *name* the engine binds to a field or a variable,
#: rather than an expression to be computed. Named once because two walkers ask the same question of
#: it — `_bare_boolean_parts`, deciding which names are read as flags, and `_value_signal_names`,
#: deciding which are read as magnitudes — and an atom added to one tuple and forgotten in the other
#: would give its signal a role the property never gave it.

#: The numeric comparison that gives a signal the flag role rather than the magnitude role.
FLAG_THRESHOLD = 0.5

#: The one temporal operator whose vacuity question is the state property's own. `always(f)` holds
#: at every position, so a trigger inside `f` that fires nowhere leaves the whole quantification
#: vacuous in exactly the way `f` is vacuous at each position. Named here rather than in
#: `engines/temporal.py` because `implication_antecedent` is a fact about the language and the
#: engine's `ALWAYS` is this constant.

)

#: The two-operand temporal operators, written in the same prefix call form `implies(a, b)` uses.
#: rtamt parses both as infix operators already; the language exposes them as prefix calls because
#: it parses through Python's `ast`, and `engines/observed.to_stl` renders them back to the infix
#: form the monitor reads. Nothing here implements their semantics — the monitor this package
#: already depends on does.
BINARY_TEMPORAL_OPERATORS = frozenset({"until", "since"})

#: Every temporal operator of the language.
TEMPORAL_OPERATORS = UNARY_TEMPORAL_OPERATORS | BINARY_TEMPORAL_OPERATORS

#: The call the arrow rewriter emits for `<=>` and `<->`, on the footing `Implies(...)` already has.
#:
#: It is a **distinct node** and deliberately not `==`. Over the Booleans equivalence *is* equality
#: of truth values, and `eval_expression` reads it that way, so nothing two-valued moved. Over the
#: residuated lattices of `manyvalued` it is not: `==` is a crisp comparison of two degrees, which
#: is a threshold, and `docs/semantics.md` §9 refuses one. Collapsing the connective textually
#: before the parse destroyed the distinction, so the refusal named a construct nobody wrote and
#: equivalence was unavailable in the graded fragment for no design reason — the same accident that
#: spared `implies`, which survived only by being spelled as a call rather than as an arrow.
#: `manyvalued.degree_of` reads this over the algebra's biresiduum.
EQUIVALENCE_CALL = "Iff"

#: The two spellings of implication, which the rewriter folds `=>`, `->` and ` implies ` into.
IMPLICATION_CALLS = frozenset({"implies", "Implies"})

#: Every call whose operands stand in Boolean position and whose value is a truth value. Named once
#: because three walkers ask the same question of it, and a connective added to one and forgotten in
#: another would give its operands a role the property never gave them.
BOOLEAN_CONNECTIVE_CALLS = IMPLICATION_CALLS | {EQUIVALENCE_CALL}

VALUE_CALLS = {"implies": 2, "Implies": 2, EQUIVALENCE_CALL: 2, "abs": 1, "min": 2, "max": 2}

#: The fragments of this language, narrowest first. `record` is a conjunction of presence atoms;
#: `logical` is any other state property of one decision record; `temporal` is anything reaching
#: across records with a temporal operator; `counterfactual` is the one relational fragment — a
#: property of a *pair* of executions rather than of any trace, and the only one nothing that reads
#: a decision log may discharge.
#:
#: `undetermined` and `graded` are the two open-texture fragments, and they are fragments rather
#: than a flag for the reason `counterfactual` is: the fragment is what decides which engines may
#: discharge a duty, and neither of these may be discharged by any of them. A spec with no
#: `degree()` atom can never be classified `graded`, which is the whole of the guarantee that a duty
#: with a sharp boundary does not acquire a truth degree because the machinery now exists.

    Every name `signal_names` reports, except those a disjunction makes into an *alternative*:
    `present(a) or present(b)` is settled by whichever of the two a system supplies, so neither `a`
    nor `b` alone is a signal the property needs. The pack loader uses this, not `signal_names`, to
    decide which names a requirement's `requires` must gate — because `requires` is a conjunctive
    gate, and listing an alternative there reports a system that lawfully took the *other* branch
    unattainable without running it.

    Two conditions narrow the exemption, and neither is optional:

    - **Every disjunct must be settled by `present()` atoms alone** (`_is_presence_only`), or the
      disjunction exempts nothing. `(latency <= 30) or (latency <= 90)` gates `latency`: a magnitude
      has to be readable before either operand exists, so a system that cannot emit it is
      unattainable on the whole clause rather than run and reported not evaluated.
    - **A name occurring in every disjunct stays gated.** `(present(a) and present(b)) or
      (present(a) and present(c))` needs `a` whichever branch settles it, so only `b` and `c` are
      alternatives. The exemption is the names of the disjunction minus the names common to all of
      its branches.

    The rest of the walk reaches disjunctions through the boolean connectives and through calls —
    `always(a and (b or c))` exempts `b` and `c`, because a temporal operator quantifies its
    argument over the trace without making the signals inside it optional. An implication is not
    treated as conditional: `Implies(a, b)` still needs `b` to be readable before it can be settled
    at all, and narrowing the gate on evaluation order would be a claim this language does not make.
    A disjunction standing as an operand of a comparison or of arithmetic is not exempt for the same
    reason: that value has to be computed before the operand exists.

    engine parses the same `spec` through it, and the antecedent is the same subtree whatever
    domain the engine goes on to quantify over. Seven engines each guard the domain they built —
    an empty trace, an empty plan, unsatisfiable premises — and not one of them could see this,

    the solver checks premises ∧ antecedent, the monitor scores the antecedent per position, the
    replay search evaluates it per replayed decision. What they do with the answer is
    `report.not_evaluated_for_unreachable_trigger`, so the sentence a reader gets is also written

    A top-level `always` is stripped first: over a finite trace `always(f)` holds exactly when `f`
    holds at every position, so an antecedent inside `f` that is true at no position leaves the

    vacuity is a different claim, about a position that never existed rather than a trigger that
    never fired — and neither is a conjunction of implications, whose antecedents are several and
