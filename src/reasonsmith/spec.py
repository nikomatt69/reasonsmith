"""Specification structures and pack loader for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Defines `Requirement` and `Pack` data structures and the loader for TOML regulation packs
  (`packs/*.toml`).

What a reader must not break:
  - `REQUIREMENT_FIELDS` is exact. A pack that omits or adds fields to a `[[requirement]]` block
    must be rejected at load time.
    Why this matters: Omitting a field prevents statutory source traceability; adding unread fields
    makes data appear to carry meaning that nothing in the codebase acts on.
  - Verbatim text and statutory citations loaded from packs must strictly match source documents
    (`docs/legal-sources.md`).
    Why this matters: Ensures requirement packs stay legally faithful to official statutory texts.
  - `spec` is a formula in the one property language of `rulelang.py`, `rationale` is the English,
    and `formalism` names which fragment of that language the formula belongs to. The loader parses
    `spec`, classifies it, and refuses a declared fragment that is not the one it found.
    Why this matters: `formalism` used to be a label nothing checked, so prose could sit in `spec`
    under `formalism = "record"` and an STL formula could be labelled `record` and silently
    downgraded. The check is what makes the field mean something.
  - `domains` names the kinds of decision a duty is about, from `DECISION_DOMAINS`, and an empty
    list means the duty is not domain-limited. It is a required field with no default, exactly as
    `binding` and `scope` are.
    Why this matters: without it, an adverse-action notice duty reached a graph-reachability
    benchmark that issues no credit and notifies nobody, and reported it `satisfied`. Defaulting a
    missing `domains` to empty would put that false positive straight back, since empty is the
    wildcard. The vocabulary is the pack author's and not any regulation's, which is a claim the
    pack must carry rather than hide — see `DECISION_DOMAINS` and `docs/authoring-packs.md`.
  - `deontic_type` and `defeasibility` classify the *clause*, are required fields with no default,
    and no engine reads either. They exist so the recurring shape of the fourth column of
    `docs/refinement.md` can be counted rather than asserted.
    Why this matters: "the general rule is formalised, the exception is not" was said of the
    shipped packs often enough to look like one missing construct. It is measurable, and the
    measurement is in `docs/refinement.md`, *The defeasibility census*. Carrying the fields is the
    whole of what this repository does with them: nothing here reasons defeasibly, and a reader
    who takes `defeasible-modelled` for a defeasible engine has read a claim the pack does not
    make.
  - Every signal name a `spec` reads *unconditionally* must appear in `requires`. A name read only
    inside a disjunction whose every branch is settled by `present()` atoms, and which does not
    occur in all of those branches, is exempt, and deliberately so.
    Why this matters: `requires` is the capability gate that decides whether a duty is attainable
    at all, and it is a conjunction — a system missing any one of its names is reported
    unattainable without being run. An unconditional name that is not gated is a signal no
    unattainability analysis ever asks for, usually a typo. But a disjunct is an *alternative*:
    where a clause is an either/or, gating both branches would report a system that lawfully took
    one of them unattainable, which is a different way of getting the answer wrong. The price of
    the exemption is that a typo inside a disjunct is not caught here — it becomes a branch nothing
    can ever satisfy — so a pack author writing a disjunction owes the signal name a second look.

#: is rejected too rather than looking like it carries data nothing acts on.
#: `binding`, `scope` and `domains` are on this list on purpose, including for externally
#: authored packs: an unclassified requirement has no safe default (see Requirement), so the
#: loader refuses the pack by name rather than guessing which kind of duty it is.

#: `docs/refinement.md` records rather than a mismatch this field papers over.
#:
#: `reparation` is the contrary-to-duty member: a duty whose antecedent is a violation or a harm,
#: which classical deontic logic cannot state without paradox and which the shipped result model —
#: a Boolean property of decision records — cannot express at all. It is listed here because
#: EU AI Act Article 55(1)(c) has that shape; what it does *not* buy is any machinery, and no

#: Whether the clause states something that switches the duty off, and whether the property
#: carries it. Two different things are told apart here on purpose, because conflating them was
#: the thing that made the gap look bigger than it is:
#:
#: - a **defeater** is an exception that overrides an otherwise-applicable duty — 12 CFR
#:   1002.9(a)(1)(ii)'s *unless notice is provided in accordance with paragraph (c)*, GDPR
#:   Article 22(2)'s *paragraph 1 shall not apply if*. Modelling one needs a priority between
#:   rules, which this property language has no notion of.
#: - a **trigger** is the clause's condition of application — adverse action having been taken,
#:   the model having systemic risk. It is an antecedent, and `rulelang` already expresses one:
#:   `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_b_2_specific_reasons` carries its own. What is missing there is a signal,
#:   not a construct.
#:
#: A duty carrying both is classified by its defeater, since that is the harder gap;
#: `docs/refinement.md`, *The defeasibility census*, names the rows where that hides a trigger.
#: A defeater counts only where the clause states it in the requirement's own `verbatim_text` or
#: in a source `docs/legal-sources.md` retrieved — the same discipline every other claim about
#: the law in this repository is held to. The census understates by whatever a wider retrieval
#: would find, and that limit is named in the document rather than hidden here.

#: The decision domains this tool knows how to name — the *kind of decision* a duty is about,

#: `REGULATORY_CLASSES` is the whole reason it is written down here rather than derived. The five
#: regulatory classes are one statute's own vocabulary: the EU AI Act defines them, so a pack can
#: quote them. No statute defines a list of decision domains. Consumer credit, employment,
#: housing, insurance, healthcare and criminal justice are carved differently by every regime that
#: carves them at all — the GDPR is not domain-limited in the first place, and the AI Act works
#: from Annex III use-cases rather than subject matters. Any closed list is therefore wrong
#: somewhere, and this one is deliberately coarse: it exists to answer *has this system said what
#: kind of decision it makes*, not to classify a system correctly for a regulator.
#:
#: What that buys is one guarantee and no more: a system that has not declared its domain is never
#: reported `satisfied` on a domain-limited duty. `docs/authoring-packs.md` (*the decision-domain
#: vocabulary is the pack author's*) states the discipline a pack owes when it uses one of these
#: names, which is the same discipline it owes an invented threshold.

#: it means "undeclared". Those are absences, not domains, and they are not the same absence.

    `spec` is the property, written in the one language of `rulelang.py`; `formalism` names which
    fragment of that language it belongs to; `rationale` is the English explanation of the duty,
    and no verdict is derived from its wording. `requires` names the signals a system must be
    capable of emitting for this requirement to be checkable at all. It is a conjunction, so a
    branch of an either/or clause does not belong in it: see `_check_spec` and the module
    docstring.
    `binding` indicates whether this duty is a legally binding obligation (true) or an
    interpretive recital/guidance item (false). `scope` records any regulatory class the duty
    is limited to; empty means the duty is not class-limited, and anything else must be a
    member of `REGULATORY_CLASSES`. `domains` records the kinds of decision the duty is about —
    a different axis, gated separately — and every entry must be a member of `DECISION_DOMAINS`.
    An empty list means the duty is not domain-limited and reaches every system it is run

    engine a deliberately unparseable property is checking what that engine does with one, and

    None of the three fields has a default, here or in the loader: defaulting a missing `binding`
    to true would silently promote an unclassified item to a legal obligation, and defaulting it
    to false would silently demote a statutory duty out of the compliance headline. Defaulting
    `scope` or `domains` to empty would make an unclassified duty a wildcard reaching every
    system — which is precisely the false positive the domain gate exists to stop, reintroduced
    as a default. A pack that has not classified a requirement is a pack that must say so and be
    fixed, not one this code guesses for.
