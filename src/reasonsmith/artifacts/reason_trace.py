"""A reason trace as one inference artefact — the second family, on the rung below.

What this module is for:
  The families of the paper's own taxonomy are a ground program, a knowledge graph, a reason trace,
  an extracted rule set and a decision tree. `artifacts/ground_program.py` was the only one shipped,
  and the reason it was the only one is written down in `docs/semantics.md` §3: a reason set the
  system *recounted* is not a set enumerated from a model encoding, a certificate over one claims
  strictly less, and the strength lattice could not say so. It can now — `Strength.RECOUNTED` — so
  this family is an adapter and no longer a decision about the lattice.

  A reason trace is what a system says about its own inference behind one decision: a set of named
  reasons, each a set of facts, with the weight the system reports for each. Two things make it
  usable evidence rather than a self-declared flag:

    - it is not the verdict. `engine_value()` re-runs the *system*, with the named facts suppressed,
      through a caller-supplied `answer` — so the probe compares what the system says it used
      against what its answer actually depends on. A reason the trace recounts that no deletion
      moves is a rationale item the decision did not turn on.
    - it is not read as an enumeration. `reasons_are_exact` is False, which is what caps every
      verdict measured from one at `recounted`: a rationale can be complete or can omit a reason the
      inference used, and no probe *of the rationale* can tell the two apart.

  That is the faithfulness question as the literature poses it — a self-explanation may be plausible
  and unfaithful (A. Jacovi, Y. Goldberg, ACL 2020, 4198–4205; M. Turpin, J. Michael, E. Perez,
  S. R. Bowman, NeurIPS 2023) — measured the way that literature measures it, by erasure
  (J. DeYoung et al., *ERASER*, ACL 2020, 4443–4458). `docs/semantics.md` §3 is the contract.

What a reader must not break:
  - **`answer` re-runs the system and is never read off the trace.** A system that cannot be re-run
    with a fact suppressed cannot be certified here, and that limit is the honest one: without a
    second, independent measurement, `exact_value` and `engine_value` are the same self-report and
    every reason comes back live by construction.
    Why this matters: the cheap version of this family would score the rationale against itself and
    report a PASS for every system that writes one, which is the self-declared flag
    `docs/semantics.md` §3 refuses in every other place.
  - **`reasons_are_exact` stays False.** It is not a property of any particular trace: it is what
    this *family* is, and a subclass that flipped it would report at the ground program's rung on a
    rationale nothing enumerated.
    Why this matters: it is the whole of what separates the two shipped families, and the rung it
    selects is refused rather than trusted (`report.RequirementResult._validate_reason_set`).
  - **`without` suppresses a fact and re-scores the same recounted reasons.** It never re-reads the
    trace and never asks the system for a new rationale.
    Why this matters: the ground-program family's own rule, one concept over. Asking a language
    model to explain itself again under the perturbation would compare two answers to two questions,
    and the second rationale is not evidence about the first decision.

class ReasonTraceArtifact:
    """The reasons a system recounts for one decision, tested against the answer it actually gives.

    `reasons` maps a reason's name — a reason code, a rationale line — to the facts the system says
    that reason rests on. `answer` is the system re-run: given the set of facts to suppress, it
    returns the answer the system gives, and `answer(frozenset())` is the answer the trace is about.

    `weights` is the weight the system reports for each reason, **on the scale of `answer`**. Where
    it reports none the unperturbed answer is split equally, which is the reading that makes the
    trace's side and the system's side commensurable: a rationale that names n reasons and no
    weights has said the answer rests on them and said nothing about how much each carries. The
    split is not a measurement and nothing here reports it as one — it decides only the order the
    certificate lists reasons in, and how large a drop each suppression is expected to cause.

    `monotone` is the declaration every artefact owes (`artifacts.InferenceArtifact`), with no
    default here for the reason the ground-program family has none: a decoder that consults a policy
    after generating a rationale is exactly the retracting engine the declaration exists to catch.
