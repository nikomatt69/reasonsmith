"""The evidence strength lattice, the evidence basis, and the verdict vocabulary for reasonsmith.

What this module is for:
  Defines the formal evidence strength lattice (`unattainable < observed < probed < proved`), the
  evidence basis beside it (`EvidenceBasis`), and the verdict vocabulary (`satisfied`, `violated`,
  `inconclusive`, `not_applicable`) for compliance checking. Compliance claims carry a verdict
  (whether a property holds), a strength (how deeply the system exposed itself for verification)
  and a basis (what kind of thing the evidence is about).

  Strengths form a strict total order (the strength lattice):
    unattainable — The system cannot discharge the requirement as built (missing signals).
    observed     — The property holds over passive decision traces (monitors / record checks).
    recounted    — The property holds under active perturbation of a reason set the *system*
                   recounted, rather than one enumerated exactly from a model encoding.
    probed       — The property holds under active perturbation/replay.
    proved       — The property holds for all inputs via formal reasoning / solver proof.

  Verdicts record whether a property is met:
    satisfied      — Evidence proves or demonstrates the requirement holds.
    violated       — Evidence demonstrates a counterexample or breach.
    inconclusive   — Evidence is insufficient, incomplete, or unattainable.
    not_applicable — The requirement's scope does not reach the system, so it was never checked.

  Lineage & Section 6.3 Scope Statements:
    The strength lattice is the operational form of Section 6.3's scope statement ("Governance,
    Monitoring, and What to Record", Stan, Sciavicco & Napoletano, JAIR 2026, p. 36:24).
    Section 6.3 asks whether an explanation "approximates or guarantees" behavior — which is
    precisely the observed / proved distinction, with probed between them and unattainable as
    the case the paper does not name: a system that cannot produce the required record at all.

What a reader must not break:
  - Do not alter the strict total order of the strength lattice
    (`UNATTAINABLE < OBSERVED < RECOUNTED < PROBED < PROVED`).
    Why this matters: Order guarantees that weaker passive evidence can never masquerade as
    active probing or formal proof.
  - `RECOUNTED` sits *below* `PROBED` and never beside it. Both rungs run the same deletion probe;
    they differ in where the reason set came from, and a set the system recounted is a claim
    nothing here can check as hard as an enumeration from a model encoding.
    Why this matters: this is the whole reason the member exists. `docs/semantics.md` §3 (*The
    inference artefact*) gated the second artefact family on the lattice being able to say it, and
    `report.RequirementResult._validate_reason_set` is where saying it became refusing it.
  - `EvidenceBasis` is a **classification and never a rank**: its members are deliberately not
    ordered, and comparing two of them raises rather than answering. The chain above ranks how far
    a claim about one kind of object was pushed; the basis says which kind of object, and the two
    are different questions.
    Why this matters: a reader handed `artifact` beside `probed` in an ordered list would read the
    basis as a fifth rung. `docs/semantics.md` §10 is the contract.
  - `BASIS_RUNGS` is the rungs each basis admits, and it is derived from what the engines can
    actually reach rather than asserted. Widen a row only when an engine for that rung exists.
    Why this matters: `RequirementResult` refuses a strength its basis does not admit, so a row
    widened ahead of an engine turns a structural refusal into a comment.
  - `RequirementResult` refuses to construct a result claiming more than it has (including
    `strength=None` for "no engine here evaluated this", which is deliberately not a strength on
    the lattice).
    Why this matters: Prevents un-evaluated or un-measured checks from being counted as satisfied
    or silently assigned a strength tier.
  - Nothing in this module asserts legal compliance or guarantees correctness beyond the formal
    bounds of the evidence provided.
    Why this matters: Technical checks measure evidence records against specifications, not legal
    counsel or guarantees.

class EvidenceBasis(Enum):
    """What kind of thing a duty's evidence is about — the second coordinate beside `Strength`.

    The strength lattice ranks *how far* a claim was pushed. It cannot rank *what the claim was
    about*, and three shipped duties are about something other than the system's own executions.
    Each of the three is a known class of specification with its own literature, and each is why
    that duty's ladder is the shape it is:

      behavioural — a property of the system's executions, one at a time: a *trace property* in the
        Alpern–Schneider sense (B. Alpern, F. B. Schneider, *Defining Liveness*, Information
        Processing Letters 21(4):181–185, 1985). Every `record`, `logical` and `temporal` duty is
        one, and all four rungs are reachable: a trace observes one execution, a replay searches
        more of them, a solver quantifies over all the declared constraints admit.
      relational — a property of a *pair* of executions: a **2-safety property** (T. Terauchi,
        A. Aiken, *Secure Information Flow as a Safety Problem*, SAS 2005, LNCS 3672, 352–367) and
        so a hyperproperty rather than a trace property (M. R. Clarkson, F. B. Schneider,
        *Hyperproperties*, Journal of Computer Security 18(6):1157–1210, 2010). Self-composition is
        the proof method (G. Barthe, P. R. D'Argenio, T. Rezk, *Secure Information Flow by
        Self-Composition*, CSFW 2004, 100–114) and `counterfactually_invariant` is the instance
        (M. J. Kusner, J. R. Loftus, C. Russell, R. Silva, *Counterfactual Fairness*, NeurIPS 2017,
        4066–4076). **No trace rung exists**, and that is the literature's point rather than this
        tool's shortfall: a hyperproperty is not a property of any single execution, so no length
        of decision log holds a witness for one.
      artifact — evidence about the *inference behind* a decision rather than about what the system
        decided: the reasons the decision's own inference used, enumerated exactly from an
        inference artefact and each switched off in turn. This is the abductive-explanation reading
        (A. Ignatiev, N. Narodytska, J. Marques-Silva, *Abduction-Based Explanations for Machine
        Learning Models*, AAAI 2019, 1511–1519; see `docs/sufficient-reasons.md` §9 for the rest),
        and the model-precise rather than behaviour-sampled side of the distinction formal XAI
        draws (J. Marques-Silva, A. Ignatiev, *Delivering Trustworthy AI through Formal XAI*,
        AAAI 2022, 12342–12350). No trace holds the artefact, and the
        enumeration is exact only on the one ground program and base interpretation it was run
        over, so it is bounded evidence and never a proof: `observed` is off this row and `proved`
        with it. The row has **two** rungs, and the lower one is `recounted` — a reason set the
        system *recounted* rather than one enumerated from a model encoding, tested by the same
        deletion probe. That is the faithfulness question of a self-reported rationale
        (A. Jacovi, Y. Goldberg, *Towards Faithfully Interpretable NLP Systems: How Should We
        Define and Evaluate Faithfulness?*, ACL 2020, 4198–4205), measured the way that literature
        measures it, by erasure (J. DeYoung, S. Jain, N. F. Rajani, E. Lehman, C. Xiong, R. Socher,
        B. C. Wallace, *ERASER: A Benchmark to Evaluate Rationalized NLP Models*, ACL 2020,
        4443–4458), on evidence a self-report can fail to be (M. Turpin, J. Michael, E. Perez,
        S. R. Bowman, *Language Models Don't Always Say What They Think: Unfaithful Explanations in
        Chain-of-Thought Prompting*, NeurIPS 2023). Same object, less deeply — the claim is still
        about the inference behind the decision — which is what makes it a rung here and not a
        fifth basis.
      assessment — evidence about how an open-textured predicate applies, supplied by a named
        authority rather than measured from the system: a truth degree over a residuated lattice
        (P. Hájek, *Metamathematics of Fuzzy Logic*, Kluwer, 1998), or the naming of the
        institution that would settle a predicate no computation does. **No rung at all**, because
        the lattice ranks methods of interrogating a system and no system was interrogated. A
        degree of truth is not a degree of belief and neither is a fraction of a proof
        (D. Dubois, H. Prade, *Possibility Theory, Probability Theory and Multiple-Valued Logics:
        A Clarification*, Annals of Mathematics and AI 32:35–66, 2001).

    The members carry **no order**. `<` and its siblings raise rather than answering, so a basis
    cannot be sorted into a ladder, compared against a strength, or rendered as a fifth rung.
