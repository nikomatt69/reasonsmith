"""Probed engine for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Evaluates state properties — `formalism = "logical"` and `formalism = "record"` alike — against
  a system that exposes no decision logic to reason over but does expose `decide()`: the opaque
  system the `proved` engine cannot reach and the `observed` engine can only watch. It searches
  for a counterexample by perturbing the inputs of the decisions the system already made and
  replaying them through `decide()`.

  A record-keeping duty is a state property like any other once it is written as a formula, so a
  system that can be re-run reaches this rung for one: `present(reason)` is checked against the
  decisions the search generates, not only against the decisions the system happened to log.

What a reader must not break:
  - Probed never rounds up to proved. "No counterexample within the budget" is a statement about
    a bounded search, not about the property, and it is reported at `Strength.PROBED` carrying
    the budget that produced it.
    Why this matters: the whole difference between this engine and the proved engine is that this
    one searched a finite set of inputs. A verdict that does not carry what was searched cannot be
    read for what it is worth, so `RequirementResult` refuses to construct a probed result whose
    `details` do not carry `probe_budget` (see `report.PROBE_BUDGET_FIELDS`) — the budget is a
    construction-time invariant, not a rendering convention.
  - Where the property is an implication, a search in which no replayed decision reached the
    antecedent is reported NOT EVALUATED, never `satisfied`.
    Why this matters: "no counterexample" is worth what the search was; a search where the trigger
    fired nowhere found no counterexample the way an empty search does. The rule is the solver's
    own (`engines/proved.py`), asked of this domain, and it is written once —
    `rulelang.implication_antecedent` names the subtree,
    `report.not_evaluated_for_unreachable_trigger` words the refusal.
  - A violation needs one witness; a satisfaction needs complete evidence. A search in which any
    planned input raised rather than producing a decision is reported NOT EVALUATED, never
    `satisfied`, naming how many went unmeasured. The rule is `engines/certificate.py`'s, asked of
    this domain, and this engine was the last rung not keeping it.
    Why this matters: the inputs a system raises on are not a random sample of the search space —
    they are the ones its own author put outside the band it answers for, which is where a
    property is most at risk. A lender correct to 40000 and raising above it would otherwise be
    reported `satisfied` on `income >= 30000 -> approved` over a domain a quarter of which it
    refused to be measured on. This is asked on the satisfied path alone: a counterexample that
    reproduced is a witness, and it stands however many inputs raised beside it.
  - No summary, budget or rendering may state a replay count larger than the number of inputs the
    property was read over. `inputs_errored` is carried in the budget and surfaced wherever the
    budget is rendered (`render._budget_line`), so the two numbers a reader sees reconcile.
    Why this matters: `evidence_summary` travels into `--json` and into every downstream consumer,
    so a count that includes inputs which raised is a false statement at the data level, not a
    rendering nicety.
  - The search MUST be reproducible: the same records, trials and seed replay the same inputs in
    the same order (`plan_inputs`), and the seed is part of the recorded budget.
    Why this matters: a report that names a budget nobody can re-derive attests to nothing.
  - A candidate counterexample MUST be replayed and seen to fail a second time before it is
    reported, and a candidate that does not reproduce is reported NOT EVALUATED, never violated.
    Why this matters: a system that answers differently on the same input has not been shown to
    violate anything; the finding would be a bug in this search reported as a breach of the duty.
  - Replay inputs are isolated against accidental mutation by the system under test. This does
    not defend against a system that deliberately subverts copying: a system that lies to its
    auditor cannot be audited by that auditor, and reasonsmith does not claim otherwise.
  - A system exposing no `decide()`, a property this engine cannot parse, or a trace with no
    decision to perturb are all reported NOT EVALUATED (`verdict=INCONCLUSIVE`, `strength=None`),
    naming which of the three happened, and never `satisfied`.
    Why this matters: absent evidence is not evidence of compliance.
  - So is a replayed decision that records something which is not a statement where a
    `contains()` atom reads one (`rulelang.NotAStatementError`). That refusal is a property that
    could not be evaluated, not an input the system failed to decide, so it is never absorbed
    into `inputs_errored` and skipped.
    Why this matters: `engines/observed.py` reports the same shape NOT EVALUATED off a trace. A
    rung that answers `satisfied` where a weaker one answers *not evaluated* would make the
    stronger claim the easier one to earn, which inverts the strength lattice.
