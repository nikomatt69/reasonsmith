"""Proved engine for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Evaluates state properties — `formalism = "logical"` and `formalism = "record"` alike — over
  decision systems that expose their decision logic via `sut.logic()`, using the Z3 SMT solver.
  A record-keeping duty written as `present(reason)` is a property of one decision like any
  other, so a system that exposes rules always assigning `reason` can have it *proved* rather
  than merely observed on the decisions it chose to log; see `_present_to_z3` for the three
  cases where that would be an overclaim and is refused instead.

What a reader must not break:
  - Solver outcomes of `unknown`, solver timeouts, or logic containing unsupported constructs MUST
    be reported as NOT EVALUATED (`verdict=INCONCLUSIVE`, `strength=None`), NEVER `satisfied` or
    `proved`.
    Why this matters: Never report `proved` from a solver result you did not obtain. Assuming an
    undecided or unmodelled property holds is the single overclaim this tool exists to prevent.
  - The encoded premises MUST be checked satisfiable before `unsat` on the negated property is
    read as a proof.
    Why this matters: `unsat` from premises no input can satisfy proves every property and its
    negation alike. A vacuous model is a modelling failure, so it is reported NOT EVALUATED.
  - Where the property is an implication, the antecedent MUST be checked satisfiable under the
    same premises before `unsat` on the negation is read as a proof.
    Why this matters: it is the premise check one quantifier deeper. `unsat` from an antecedent no
    admissible input reaches proves the implication and every other implication with that
    antecedent, so the verdict is a fact about the formula wearing the strongest rung this tool
    issues. `rulelang.implication_antecedent` names the subtree and
    `report.not_evaluated_for_unreachable_trigger` words the refusal, both once for every engine.
  - Rule assignments MUST be encoded in static single assignment form.
    Why this matters: `logic()` describes a program executed statement by statement, so `score =
    score + 10` reassigns. Encoding it as one equality per name turns reassignment into a
    contradiction, which is the vacuous proof above wearing a different hat.
  - The encoding MUST be checked against the reference interpreter on the premise model before any
    verdict is read off the solver, and a disagreement MUST be reported as NOT EVALUATED.
    Why this matters: this module and `rulelang` are two implementations of one language, and the
    solver is free to exploit any gap between them — a declared sort narrowing the inputs, an
    operator that rounds differently — to make a property come out `unsat` for a reason the system
    does not implement. One agreed witness is not a proof of equivalence, but it is what catches
    the divergence before it is reported as `proved`.
  - A `proved` verdict resting on Real arithmetic MUST carry `REAL_ARITHMETIC_LIMIT`.
    Why this matters: the solver reasons over exact rationals while the system runs float64, so
    `t = a + b; d = t - b` proves `d == a` and yet returns 0.10000000000000003 for a=0.1, b=0.2.
    Encoding IEEE floats would be a different engine; naming the abstraction on the result that
    makes the claim is what stops `proved` from being read as more than it is.
  - A property reading a name the declared rules never assign MUST be refused where reading it is
    a claim about what the system computed — `present`, `contains` and a comparison of magnitudes
    alike (`_present_to_z3`, `_contains_to_z3`, `_check_magnitudes_are_computed`, and
    `_check_declared_directions` on top of it wherever the logic declares directions).
    Why this matters: such a name is a free constant of this encoding. `deviation <= margin` over
    two of them is arithmetic over numbers nobody computed, and the counterexample verification
    cannot catch it because the reference interpreter is handed the same free inputs.
  - Where `sut.logic()` declares `computes`, a name in neither `computes` nor `variables` MUST be
    refused outright, and that declaration MUST NOT admit anything the sort heuristic refuses:
    both guards run, and a declaration narrows what reaches the solver rather than widening it.
    Why this matters: a name the system has no notion of is one `_Scope.read` invents a constant
    for, and every verdict downstream is then about the invention. The heuristic below cannot see
    that at all; it can only ask what sort a name would get, which is the wrong question — but
    `variables` is a type table, so it cannot answer the heuristic's question either: a caller
    listing a name the system merely logs is not calling it an input, and reading it as one
    restores the `violated`-at-`proved` verdict over uncomputed numbers in one direction and, once
    a constraint mentions those numbers, a `satisfied`-at-`proved` verdict on a duty the system
    asserted about itself in the other.
  - A counterexample model produced by Z3 MUST be verified to reproduce on the system under test
    before reporting `VIOLATED` at strength `PROVED`, and the evidence summary must say what that
    verification actually ran against.
    Why this matters: A counterexample that does not reproduce on the actual system under test is
    worse than none and indicates a model mismatch. If verification fails, report NOT EVALUATED.

      question ranges over. Firing on every unassigned name would silence that duty.

    Keeping the antecedent case is what the first condition buys: `income >= 30000 and age >= 18
    implies approved == True` reads three free magnitudes and one computed `approved`, and it is a
    claim about what the system decides. Proving it is the engine's whole purpose.

    **It is a heuristic, and cuts along the wrong joint.** The distinction that matters is an
    *input to the decision situation* versus an *output the system computes*, and it answers that
    with a name's sort and reachability, which are proxies for neither. `logic()` may now declare
    `computes`, and where it does `_check_declared_directions` asks the question directly — but
    this guard runs **as well**, never instead. A declaration may narrow what reaches the solver
    and may not widen it, because the two guards refuse on different grounds and neither subsumes
    the other: `variables` is a type table, so a name listed there and absent from `computes` is
    not thereby an input the situation supplies — it may be one the system merely logs, and a
    declaration read as though it were hands back exactly the `violated`-at-`proved` verdict this
    guard stops, over numbers nobody computed. A constraint mentioning those numbers is worse
    still: it makes the same encoding report `satisfied` at `proved` on a duty the system has
    asserted about itself. `docs/semantics.md` §3.5 states the pair, for the reader.

    Runs whenever `sut.logic()` declares `computes`, and asks the question
    `_check_magnitudes_are_computed` could only approximate — *beside* that guard rather than in
    place of it, so a declaration narrows what reaches the solver and never widens it. The
    declaration splits every name into three, the two lists together supplying the outer boundary
    and `computes` the inner one:

    - **in `computes`** — an output the system produces. `RulesAdapter` keeps `computes` a subset
      of `variables`, but nothing in the protocol requires an adapter to repeat a computed name in
      the type table, so a name declared computed and nothing else is an output here and not an
      unknown: it is a name the system said it produces, whatever sort `_declare` gives it.
    - **in `variables`, not in `computes`** — a name the type table gives a sort and the
      declaration does not call an output. That is *at most* an input the decision situation
      supplies, and the solver's free constant is the right encoding of one, so quantifying over
      it is what a proof *is*: `income >= 30000 implies approved` and
      `gdpr_art22_1_no_prohibited_decision_for_any_input` both live here. It is not *only* that,
      because `variables` is a type table and a caller may list a name the system merely logs —
      which is why `_check_magnitudes_are_computed` still runs after this.
    - **in neither** — a name the system has no notion of.

    Two refusals follow, and neither is a judgement about the property:

    - **A name the system has no notion of.** `_Scope.read` declares a constant for any name it
      meets, so without this the encoding invents the very value the verdict is then about. This is
      the defect `_check_magnitudes_are_computed` was written against, caught at its own joint:
      a system deciding on a score alone has no `artifact_logs_decision_margin`, and it does not
      matter what sort one would be given.
    - **A declared output the exposed rules do not settle on every path.** The system says it
      computes this name and the logic it handed over does not show how, so the constant standing
      in for it is free after all. `present()` and `contains()` refuse the same thing for their own
      atoms and with their own wording, which is why this runs after the property is encoded rather
      than before: their message is the more specific one and should win.

    Both are `UnsupportedConstructError`, so the duty falls to the strongest engine that *can*
    discharge it (`report._engine_ladder`) rather than losing its verdict.

    What this does not do is second-guess the declaration. An adapter that calls an output an input
    is claiming its situation supplies a value it in fact produces, and this engine will duly prove
    things about that claim — the same trust `system_domains` is given, and stated in
    `docs/semantics.md` §3.5.
