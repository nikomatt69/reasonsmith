"""Certificate engine for reasonsmith v0.2.

What this module is for:
  Evaluates a *reason adequacy* duty — whether the reasons a decision states are all the reasons
  its own inference had — by running `reasonsmith.certificate.certify` against the inference
  artefact the system exposes, and grounding one measured signal,
  `artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count`, with what the deletion probe found.

  This is the bridge between the two halves of this package. The certificate could compare an
  engine's answer against exact inference and name the reasons the engine stopped depending on,
  but no duty and no CLI verb reached it: its only caller was the demonstration. Meanwhile the
  strongest thing a reason-giving duty could claim was that the reason field was non-blank and
  carried none of two forbidden phrases — which the demonstration's own decision `APP-1042`
  satisfies while four of its five legally owed reasons are missing. The tool shipped a
  counterexample to its own verdict. This engine is what closes that: the same decision now
  reports the adequacy duty *violated*, from the measurement rather than from the log.

What a reader must not break:
  - The measured count is never read from the system's own record. `_env` overwrites whatever a
    record carries for `artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count` with the count the probe measured.
    Why this matters: a system that could settle this duty by logging a zero would be grading its
    own homework — the self-declared flag `docs/semantics.md` §3 refuses. The whole point of this
    rung is that the number comes from exact inference over the artefact, not from the log.
  - A system that exposes no `artifact()` oracle is reported UNATTAINABLE naming
    `artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count`, never satisfied and never downgraded to a presence
    check on the reason field. `report._engine_ladder` gives this duty no other rung for the same
    reason (see its `CertificateEngine` branch).
    Why this matters: substituting the presence property for the adequacy property is exactly the
    defect this engine exists to remove. A duty about whether the stated reasons are *all* the
    reasons cannot be discharged by observing that some reason was stated.
  - An artefact the deletion definition of a reason does not apply to is refused **before** it is
    measured, and the refusal is NOT EVALUATED: never violated, never satisfied, and never handed
    down to a weaker duty. Three states reach it — an artefact declaring its inference
    non-monotone, one declaring nothing, and one declaring itself monotone that the probe then
    contradicted — and `artifacts.deletion_semantics_refusal` words all three once.
    Why this matters: the probe is one-directional, so on a non-monotone inference a lawfully
    retracted reason is indistinguishable from a dropped one and this engine reports a compliant
    creditor violated. Measuring anyway and disclosing the limit was the previous answer; the
    declaration is what lets the refusal be structural. It is *not evaluated* rather than
    *unattainable* because the gap is in this tool and not in the system: a creditor whose policy
    exceptions retract reasons is behaving as designed, and "change the system" is the wrong
    instruction to hand it (`docs/semantics.md` §4, the four outcomes).
  - One refused artefact refuses the **run**, not just its own decision.
    Why this matters: a verdict assembled from the decisions that happened to be monotone is a
    verdict over a subset, and the rule below — a satisfaction needs complete evidence — already
    refuses those. Reporting `violated` off the remainder would also leave the reader unable to see
    that the trace held a decision this instrument cannot read at all.
  - The strength is PROBED or RECOUNTED, and never PROVED. The certificate's reach is the decisions
    the system supplied and the deletion probes those decisions admitted, and `RequirementResult`
    refuses to construct the result without the budget that names both. Which of the two rungs is
    decided by the *artefacts* and not by the search: one certified decision whose reason set the
    system recounted rather than enumerated caps the run at RECOUNTED, and the flag that says so
    (`report.EXACT_REASON_SET_KEY`) travels on the result, where `_validate_reason_set` refuses a
    claim above it.
    Why this matters: exact inference is exact *on one ground program and one base
    interpretation* — `certificate.LIMITS` says so in its own words. Nothing here establishes the
    property for a decision the system did not expose, and a rationale the system recounted
    establishes less again: see `artifacts.RECOUNTED_REASONS`.
  - A reason the probe could not settle (`unseparable`, `inconclusive`, `undetermined`) is not
    counted as deleted, and the count of them is reported.
    Why this matters: `certificate.certify` never assumes such a reason is live, and neither may
    this engine assume it was dropped. Counting it either way would put a verdict on evidence the
    probe explicitly declined to produce.
  - The joint-deletion search's probes are counted into `trials` and whether it *finished* is
    carried in `input_space`, beside the reasons it left `undetermined`.
    Why this matters: a reason is `deleted` only where that enumeration ran to exhaustion
    (`docs/sufficient-reasons.md` §7), so how far it got is not a curiosity about performance — it
    is the bound on what every `deleted` here claims, and `PROBE_BUDGET_FIELDS` exists so a bound
    a reader cannot see cannot be relied on.
  - A certificate whose enumeration found *no* reason measures nothing, and is evidence for
    nothing. It is dropped from the certified set, counted, and reported, and no run holding one
    reports SATISFIED: it is NOT EVALUATED naming `artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count`.
    Why this matters: `len(cert.deleted)` is zero on such a certificate for the same reason it is
    zero on a decision whose reasons the engine all used, and the two are not the same fact. The
    engine asks `conformance.measured(cert)` — this package's single predicate for whether a
    certificate measured anything at all, and the no-enumerated-reason clause of
    `Certificate.verdict`'s refusal to report PASS, "a zero value gap on an un-enumerated query is
    not agreement; exact inference never evaluated it" — rather than reading the zero. That
    property's other clause, that `uncertified` also blocks PASS, is deliberately *not* acted on
    here: an unseparable reason stays in the certified set and is reported as a caveat rather than
    turning the verdict. Lowering the artefact's own `exact_depth` to 0 would otherwise turn the
    demonstration's breached decision clean, which is weaker evidence buying a stronger verdict.
  - A certified decision whose reasons the notice never stated does not satisfy this duty
    vacuously: a run where the property's antecedent held on no certified decision is reported NOT
    EVALUATED, never `satisfied`. The rule is not this engine's own — it is written once,
    `rulelang.implication_antecedent` naming the subtree and
    `report.not_evaluated_for_unreachable_trigger` wording the refusal — and the antecedent is
    counted in the same walk that decides the property, exactly as `engines/probed.py` counts the
    replays that reached it.
    Why this matters: this duty is written as an implication so a creditor lawfully on the
    12 CFR 1002.9(a)(2)(ii) disclosure branch is not accused of an inadequate statement it never
    made. Reading that as `satisfied` would report every such system alike clean on the adequacy of
    a statement no decision carried, which is the same empty claim at the same strength this
    engine's own reason for existing was to remove.
  - A violation needs one witness; a satisfaction needs complete evidence. A measured breach is
    reported VIOLATED however many decisions went unmeasured beside it, while SATISFIED requires
    that every certified decision was measured.
    Why this matters: the lenient rule — satisfied over whatever remained — is defeated by the
    same move the refusal above was written to stop: declare `exact_depth=0` on every decision but
    one genuinely clean one and the duty reports satisfied again. This is not the
    `decisions_without_an_artifact` case and that precedent must not be cited as one: a decision
    without an artefact was never certified, while a decision whose artefact declared depth 0 was
    certified and produced nothing — a stronger signal, not a weaker one. The asymmetry is the one
    `docs/semantics.md` §3 already states for a trace, a satisfied verdict being universal over it
    and a violated one existential.
