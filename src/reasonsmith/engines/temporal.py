"""Temporal proof engine for reasonsmith.

What this module is for:
  Discharges a `temporal` duty of the shape `always(f)` — with `f` a state property of one
  decision record — against a system that exposes its decision logic, at strength `proved`. It is
  the rung `docs/semantics.md` §3.5 said did not exist: before it, every `temporal` duty stopped at
  `observed` whatever the system exposed, because the solver and the replay search each reason
  about one decision at a time and had nothing to say about a formula quantified over a trace.

  The reasoning is one reduction and no new machinery. Over a **finite** decision trace — which is
  what a conformance run reads, and why LTLf rather than LTL is the semantics this engine claims —
  `always(f)` holds exactly when `f` holds at every position. Every position of every trace this
  system can emit is a decision its exposed `logic()` produces from an input its own `constraints`
  admit. So a proof that `f` holds over that whole input space is a proof of `always(f)` for every
  trace the system can emit, not merely for the one this run happened to read. The proof itself is
  `engines.proved.ProvedEngine` — the same Z3 encoding, the same premise-satisfiability check, the
  same interpreter cross-check, the same counterexample verification — asked about `f`.

  That is why this engine adds no dependency. An LTLf decision procedure was priced first
  (`pylogics` with `ltlf2dfa`, and Spot); both were rejected, and the PR that landed this records
  what each one needed. Neither is required for this fragment: `always` distributes over positions,
  so the formula the solver decides is a state property, and one of those this repository already
  decides. One has since been installed — `src/reasonsmith/ltlf.py`, behind the optional `ltlf`
  extra — and it changes nothing here: it decides a duty as a *formula* for `validate-pack
  --analyse`, is never given a system, and occupies no rung. This engine's reduction is still the
  only thing that puts a temporal duty at `proved`.

What a reader must not break:
  - **Only `always(f)`, and only with `f` free of temporal operators.** Every other temporal shape
    is reported NOT EVALUATED, so the duty falls to `ObservedEngine` exactly as it did before this
    engine existed. `eventually(f)` is the one worth naming: it asserts that *some* position exists,
    which is a fact about the trace a system emitted and not about the decisions its logic admits,
    so no amount of reasoning about one decision at a time establishes it. Widening
    `state_property_under_always` to accept it would report `proved` for a claim nothing proved.
    (`test_only_always_reaches_the_temporal_proof_rung`)
  - **A `satisfied` verdict and a `violated` verdict here do not make symmetric claims, and the
    evidence summary must keep saying so.** Satisfied quantifies universally and therefore covers
    every trace the system can emit, this run's included. Violated is existential: the solver found
    an admissible input whose decision breaches `f`, verified to reproduce on the system, so *some*
    trace the system admits breaches the duty — which is a finding about the system as built and
    not a finding about the trace supplied here. That asymmetry is inherited from `ProvedEngine`,
    where it is already what `proved` means, and `TRACE_SEMANTICS` is where it is stated to the
    reader. (`test_a_temporal_violation_names_the_trace_it_is_and_is_not_about`)
  - Everything `ProvedEngine`'s own docstring forbids is forbidden here, because this engine's
    verdict is that engine's verdict: an `unknown` solver result, a timeout, unsatisfiable
    premises, an encoding that disagrees with the reference interpreter, or a counterexample that
    does not reproduce all still yield NOT EVALUATED rather than a rung.

    property. `None` too for `always(eventually(f))` and friends: the operand must be a state
    property, or what the solver decides is not what the duty says.

    Returns the operand as text rather than as an AST, so that `ProvedEngine` parses it through
    exactly the path a hand-written `spec` takes and no second parser exists to disagree with the
    first. Arrow forms survive that round trip as `Implies(...)`, which is in the language.
