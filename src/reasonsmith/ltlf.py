"""A finite-trace decision procedure for the temporal fragment, behind an optional extra.

What this module is for:
  `analysis.py` decides a pack's questions — joint satisfiability, entailment, equivalence — with
  Z3, over one decision record. A `temporal` spec is not a property of one record, so the analysis
  reduced the one shape that is — `always(f)`, through
  `engines/temporal.state_property_under_always` — and reported every other shape skipped.
  `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_c_2_incompleteness_notice_runs_out` is written with `until`; nothing in
  `validate-pack --analyse` could say anything about it at all.

  This module answers those questions for the whole fragment by handing the formula to a published
  LTLf decision procedure. It is **a syntax mapping and an emptiness question, and nothing else** —
  the same discipline `engines/observed.to_stl` observes for rtamt. `flloat` (Favorito & Fuggitti,
  Apache-2.0) compiles an LTLf formula to a DFA over its propositional atoms; a formula is
  satisfiable exactly when that automaton's language is non-empty, entailment is
  `left & !right` unsatisfiable, and equivalence is entailment both ways. No temporal semantics,
  automaton construction, tableau or monitor is implemented here, and none may be.

  What was priced against `flloat`, so the choice is reconstructible rather than asserted. **BLACK**
  (Geatti, Gigante, Montanari; MIT) decides LTL, LTL+Past and LTLf and would have covered the past
  operators this does not, but publishes no PyPI distribution under any name searched, so
  integrating it means shipping a subprocess boundary onto a binary a user installs by hand.
  **LTLf2DFA** and **Lydia** compile LTLf to a minimal DFA through **MONA**, which is a native
  package (`apt install mona`) and not a wheel: `pip install reasonsmith[ltlf]` would succeed and
  the tool would still not run, which is worse than no extra. **Spot** is mature and has Python
  bindings, and is likewise not on PyPI. **nuXmv** is free for non-commercial use only and must not
  go on a dependency path at all. `flloat` is the one candidate that is pure Python on PyPI, and it
  is chosen for exactly that: the extra installs with no native toolchain. It is paid for in the
  ceiling `ATOM_BUDGET` records — measured, not assumed — and in having no past operators.

  It is deliberately **not** under `engines/`. An engine returns a `RequirementResult` about a
  system and occupies a rung of the strength lattice. This decides formulas, is never given a
  system, and adds no rung: `release discipline` counts the modules under `engines/` and the count
  in `ROADMAP.md` and `README.md` is still right.

What a reader must not break:
  - **rtamt keeps every magnitude; this keeps every qualitative question.** The two backends are
    not interchangeable, and the split is not a preference. rtamt monitors a real-valued signal and
    scores robustness; LTLf is propositional, so every comparison of magnitudes here becomes one
    opaque Boolean atom and `x <= 30` bears no relation to `x <= 90`. That abstraction is **sound
    for the entailments it reports and incomplete for the ones it does not**, exactly as
    `analysis._PackScope` already says of the record atoms — and it is *unsound in the other
    direction for satisfiability*, which is why `satisfiable()` is only ever used to report a pack
    consistent, never to report one contradictory. `LTLF_ABSTRACTION_LIMIT` states it on every
    answer that rests on it.
  - **The extra is optional and its absence is reported, never worked around.** `pip install
    reasonsmith` stays a two-command demo: `flloat` arrives with `pip install reasonsmith[ltlf]`.
    With it absent, `available()` is False and the analysis says so in a note; nothing degrades to
    a weaker answer presented as the same one.
    (`test_the_analysis_says_so_when_the_extra_is_absent`)
  - **Only the future fragment.** `flloat` parses LTLf, which has no past operators, so a spec
    using `once`, `historically`, `prev`, `since`, `rise` or `fall` is refused **by name** into the
    analysis' `skipped` list. Rendering one into a future operator would be implementing its
    semantics. (`test_a_past_operator_is_skipped_by_name_rather_than_rendered`)
  - **Every question is asked over a non-empty trace.** LTLf as `flloat` implements it admits the
    empty trace, on which `always(f)` holds whatever `f` says — so every `always` duty would be
    reported satisfiable by a trace no monitor ever reads. `NON_EMPTY` is the LTLf formula for
    "there is a position", conjoined into every question, so the models this reports are the traces
    the monitors run on. It is a formula and not a construction.
