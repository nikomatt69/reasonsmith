# Example Output

Every block below is stdout pasted unedited from a real run, not a hand-written illustration of
what the tool would print. Regenerate any block by running the command shown above it.

- **Capture provenance:** the demo transcript was captured at commit
  `8b4c72042443dfdb116c851d67f6dc3884392665` (branch `fm/rs-land-contributor-demos`), where it was
  regenerated over the four Table 7 demos added on that branch. The CLI blocks were regenerated
  from the commands below for the property-language change; `test_committed_transcripts_are_the_real_stdout`
  re-runs all three commands and holds every committed block to its real stdout.
- **Version:** every block below was generated on reasonsmith `0.7.0`, the version of the tree
  these transcripts were captured from. If the same command prints differently on your install,
  your `reasonsmith` is a different version than this document describes — `pip show reasonsmith`
  will name it. A mismatch against an older release means this document is ahead of your package,
  not that your install is broken; upgrade to `0.7.0` or newer and re-run before comparing.
- **Environment:** Python 3.12.9, Linux, `nesyarena` at the commit `pyproject.toml` pinned when
  these transcripts were captured (`57720fa212834689692e171882272140f1d1fed7`); re-run since
  against the PyPI release `nesyarena==0.1.0` now pinned, byte-for-byte identical
- **Demo transcript:** 909 lines, `md5sum` `259fb66c4ebe4ce5c4b136c0e947f4cb` — the same length and
  hash [RESULTS.md](../RESULTS.md) reports, which is what lets the two files be checked against
  each other

What a transcript is not: a compliance result. Each block carries its own LIMITS paragraph, and
those limits travel with the numbers above them.

                    deleting dti_above_policy(APP-1042) moves exact inference by -0.028093 and the engine by -0.068400: the engine's answer depends on this reason. All 2 private fact(s) of this reason were switched off, one at a time.

MISSING REASONS: the engine's answer does not depend on 4 reason(s) that exact inference found:
  - C02 — Length of time credit has been established is too short: file_thin(APP-1042), history_under_24_months(APP-1042)
  - C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations: bureau_record_matched(APP-1042), delinquency_on_file(APP-1042)
  - C04 — Too many recent inquiries on credit bureau report: bureau_record_matched(APP-1042), inquiries_over_policy(APP-1042)
  - C05 — Insufficient number of credit references provided: application_complete(APP-1042), references_under_policy(APP-1042)

ATTRIBUTION: The deleted reasons are exactly the 4 lowest-scoring of the 5, and the engine kept the top 1. This is the signature of top-k proof truncation at k=1: top-k works by discarding proofs, so the dropped reasons are lost by configuration, not by error. The missing probability mass is 0.225799.

LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
  This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found. The probe is one-directional: it only switches facts off, never on, so `deleted` means the engine's answer did not depend on this reason *under this interpretation*. On a system whose reasons can be retracted by an added fact — a policy exception evaluated after the rules fire — a lawfully retracted reason is reported deleted here exactly as a dropped one is, and can drive a violated verdict against a system that stated its reasons correctly. Which is why the artefact declares whether its inference is monotone, and a certificate over one that declares it is not, declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe carries no verdict at all. Where a deletion moves the engine's answer up, that is reported as a possible non-monotonicity, and it is the only fingerprint of the condition this instrument can leave. A reason is reported deleted only where a bounded enumeration of the joint deletions this engine notices ran to exhaustion and met no fact of that reason; where the budget ran out first the reason is reported neither way, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more.

Exact inference on the same program and the same base interpretation recovers every one of them:

LIMITS OF THIS RECORD
  This record is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It reproduces the minimal evidence fields that one peer-reviewed review (Table 7 of the source named above) associates with the cited duty. Whether those fields discharge the duty, and whether the values supplied for them are accurate, are determinations this tool does not make and cannot make.

Read those two together. The record is COMPLETE — every field Table 7 lists for row 4 was produced.
The certificate says the stored reasons are not all the reasons. Table 7 completeness is a check on the
form of the record, not on the truth of what it contains; under 12 CFR 1002.9 the notice must state the
specific principal reasons, and 4 of 5 are absent from this one.

Withholding one required field — the audit IDs — is refused loudly rather than papered over:

ATTRIBUTION: The deleted reasons are exactly the 4 lowest-scoring of the 5, and the engine kept the top 1. This is the signature of top-k proof truncation at k=1: top-k works by discarding proofs, so the dropped reasons are lost by configuration, not by error. The missing probability mass is 0.260424.

LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
  This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found. The probe is one-directional: it only switches facts off, never on, so `deleted` means the engine's answer did not depend on this reason *under this interpretation*. On a system whose reasons can be retracted by an added fact — a policy exception evaluated after the rules fire — a lawfully retracted reason is reported deleted here exactly as a dropped one is, and can drive a violated verdict against a system that stated its reasons correctly. Which is why the artefact declares whether its inference is monotone, and a certificate over one that declares it is not, declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe carries no verdict at all. Where a deletion moves the engine's answer up, that is reported as a possible non-monotonicity, and it is the only fingerprint of the condition this instrument can leave. A reason is reported deleted only where a bounded enumeration of the joint deletions this engine notices ran to exhaustion and met no fact of that reason; where the budget ran out first the reason is reported neither way, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more.

Exact inference recovers the reasons the top-k setting discarded:

ATTRIBUTION: No reason was deleted, but the engine's value differs from exact inference by -0.029742. The responsible setting is the engine's aggregation over the reasons it kept, not proof truncation: every reason still moves the answer.

LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
  This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found. The probe is one-directional: it only switches facts off, never on, so `deleted` means the engine's answer did not depend on this reason *under this interpretation*. On a system whose reasons can be retracted by an added fact — a policy exception evaluated after the rules fire — a lawfully retracted reason is reported deleted here exactly as a dropped one is, and can drive a violated verdict against a system that stated its reasons correctly. Which is why the artefact declares whether its inference is monotone, and a certificate over one that declares it is not, declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe carries no verdict at all. Where a deletion moves the engine's answer up, that is reported as a possible non-monotonicity, and it is the only fingerprint of the condition this instrument can leave. A reason is reported deleted only where a bounded enumeration of the joint deletions this engine notices ran to exhaustion and met no fact of that reason; where the budget ran out first the reason is reported neither way, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more.

An instrument that passed a corrupted engine would be worthless, so both perturbations must fail, and by
different routes: the silent drop is caught by the deletion probe, which names the reason that stopped
mattering; the undeclared calibration keeps every reason live and is caught only by the value check against
the exact oracle. Neither check subsumes the other, which is why the certificate requires both.

4. STRATIFIED PER-GROUP CHECKS (Table 19: minority over-smoothing)

Registered hypothesis, stated before the measurement: low-probability reasons are dropped first, so
atypical cases lose reasons faster. Two cohort designs separate the two things that could drive that.

design A: confidence varies, reason structure fixed

LIMITS OF THESE MEASUREMENTS
  These are measurements on the cases supplied, not a compliance guarantee and not legal advice. A per-group figure is only as representative as the cases behind it, and a group with few cases carries a correspondingly weak measurement.

OUTCOME OF THE REGISTERED HYPOTHESIS

  Design A — confidence varies, reason structure fixed:
    coverage         no gap (typical 0.3333, atypical 0.3333)
    retained_share   gap 0.2802, worse for atypical (typical 0.7731, atypical 0.4929)
    fidelity         gap 0.0535, worse for atypical (typical 0.7807, atypical 0.7272)

  Design B — reason multiplicity varies, confidence fixed:
    coverage         gap 0.3000, worse for atypical (typical 0.5000, atypical 0.2000)
    retained_share   gap 0.1129, worse for atypical (typical 0.7292, atypical 0.6163)
    fidelity         gap 0.1472, worse for atypical (typical 0.7831, atypical 0.6360)

  In its confidence form the hypothesis is NOT supported. Lowering confidence alone does not cost a case any
  reasons: top-k keeps a fixed number of proofs, and scaling every score down leaves their order unchanged, so
  coverage is identical across the two groups of design A. The atypical group is still worse off, but on the
  value metrics rather than the reason count — it keeps a smaller share of the answer it would have had under
  exact inference.

  In its multiplicity form it is supported: a case that trips five reasons and is told one keeps a fifth of its
  reasons, a case that trips two keeps half. Coverage moves in design B and not in design A, which locates the
  mechanism in how many reasons a case trips, not in how confident the model is about them.

  Both readings were registered in advance and both are reported. The negative half is the more useful one: a
  per-group coverage check will not detect confidence-driven harm at all, so a deployment watching coverage alone
  would have seen design A as clean. Retained share is what caught it.

  The limit that matters most: these are frozen synthetic cohorts, built to separate two mechanisms. Whether real
  atypical cases trip more reasons than typical ones is an empirical question about data this does not have.

====================================================================================================
5. STABILITY ACROSS WINDOWS (Table 19)
====================================================================================================

One decision, four monitoring windows, one drifting signal: the bureau's delinquency evidence strengthens
window by window. Nothing about the program changes, and the applicant's other evidence does not change.
  window 0: reason given = C01 — Income insufficient for amount of credit requested
  window 1: reason given = C01 — Income insufficient for amount of credit requested
  window 2: reason given = C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations
  window 3: reason given = C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations

  stability across the four windows: 0.3333 (1.0 would mean the same reasons every window)

  The applicant's file did not change, and the reason they are given did. Under a top-1 setting the reason
  stated is whichever proof currently scores highest, so drift in one signal silently replaces the stated
  reason with another. Exact inference has nothing to reorder — it gives all of them in every window.

6. EU AI ACT ART. 13 — TRANSPARENCY AND INFORMATION TO DEPLOYERS (Table 7 row 1)
====================================================================================================

Credit scoring is Annex III high-risk, so the provider owes the deployer an information package, and
row 1 lists what it must retain. Five of the six fields are provenance the provider hands over; the sixth,
fidelity/coverage, is the one this package computes — measured here on the deployed top-1 engine against
exact inference on the same program.

    MISSING REASONS: the engine's answer does not depend on 4 reason(s) that exact inference found:
      - C02 — Length of time credit has been established is too short: file_thin(APP-1042), history_under_24_months(APP-1042)
      - C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations: bureau_record_matched(APP-1042), delinquency_on_file(APP-1042)

      - C05 — Insufficient number of credit references provided: application_complete(APP-1042), references_under_policy(APP-1042)
    
    ATTRIBUTION: The deleted reasons are exactly the 4 lowest-scoring of the 5, and the engine kept the top 1. This is the signature of top-k proof truncation at k=1: top-k works by discarding proofs, so the dropped reasons are lost by configuration, not by error. The missing probability mass is 0.225799.
    
    LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
      This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found. The probe is one-directional: it only switches facts off, never on, so `deleted` means the engine's answer did not depend on this reason *under this interpretation*. On a system whose reasons can be retracted by an added fact — a policy exception evaluated after the rules fire — a lawfully retracted reason is reported deleted here exactly as a dropped one is, and can drive a violated verdict against a system that stated its reasons correctly. Which is why the artefact declares whether its inference is monotone, and a certificate over one that declares it is not, declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe carries no verdict at all. Where a deletion moves the engine's answer up, that is reported as a possible non-monotonicity, and it is the only fingerprint of the condition this instrument can leave. A reason is reported deleted only where a bounded enumeration of the joint deletions this engine notices ran to exhaustion and met no fact of that reason; where the budget ran out first the reason is reported neither way, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more.

LIMITS OF THIS RECORD
  This record is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It reproduces the minimal evidence fields that one peer-reviewed review (Table 7 of the source named above) associates with the cited duty. Whether those fields discharge the duty, and whether the values supplied for them are accurate, are determinations this tool does not make and cannot make.

The record is COMPLETE, and its own numbers argue against the engine it documents. Coverage 0.2000
means the deployer is told, in the provider's own package, that the stated reasons are 1 of
5. That is Art. 13 working as intended: transparency is not the absence of gaps, it is
the gaps being on the page. A package whose fidelity/coverage figures were asserted rather than measured
would pass the same form check while saying nothing — which is why this field is computed from the
certificate and never accepted as input.

LIMITS: the provenance values above are fixed stand-ins for a synthetic cohort; a real package draws
them from its model registry and dataset store. The measured field transfers unchanged.

====================================================================================================
7. EU AI ACT ART. 12 — RECORD-KEEPING / EVENT LOGGING (Table 7 row 2)
====================================================================================================

Art. 12 makes the logging subsystem part of the compliance surface: each event record must name the
chosen branch and the constraints that were active, not just the final answer. The certificate is the one
place both halves already exist, so the log entry below is built from it — exact inference supplies the
active set, the engine's answer supplies the choice.

    MISSING REASONS: the engine's answer does not depend on 4 reason(s) that exact inference found:
      - C02 — Length of time credit has been established is too short: file_thin(APP-1042), history_under_24_months(APP-1042)
      - C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations: bureau_record_matched(APP-1042), delinquency_on_file(APP-1042)
      - C04 — Too many recent inquiries on credit bureau report: bureau_record_matched(APP-1042), inquiries_over_policy(APP-1042)
      - C05 — Insufficient number of credit references provided: application_complete(APP-1042), references_under_policy(APP-1042)
    
    ATTRIBUTION: The deleted reasons are exactly the 4 lowest-scoring of the 5, and the engine kept the top 1. This is the signature of top-k proof truncation at k=1: top-k works by discarding proofs, so the dropped reasons are lost by configuration, not by error. The missing probability mass is 0.225799.
    
    LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
      This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found. The probe is one-directional: it only switches facts off, never on, so `deleted` means the engine's answer did not depend on this reason *under this interpretation*. On a system whose reasons can be retracted by an added fact — a policy exception evaluated after the rules fire — a lawfully retracted reason is reported deleted here exactly as a dropped one is, and can drive a violated verdict against a system that stated its reasons correctly. Which is why the artefact declares whether its inference is monotone, and a certificate over one that declares it is not, declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe carries no verdict at all. Where a deletion moves the engine's answer up, that is reported as a possible non-monotonicity, and it is the only fingerprint of the condition this instrument can leave. A reason is reported deleted only where a bounded enumeration of the joint deletions this engine notices ran to exhaustion and met no fact of that reason; where the budget ran out first the reason is reported neither way, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more.

LIMITS OF THIS RECORD
  This record is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It reproduces the minimal evidence fields that one peer-reviewed review (Table 7 of the source named above) associates with the cited duty. Whether those fields discharge the duty, and whether the values supplied for them are accurate, are determinations this tool does not make and cannot make.

Read the log line against the certificate: branch C01 chosen, five constraints active, four of them absent
from the output. That gap is not an Art. 12 violation — the rule does not say the engine must use every
constraint — but Art. 12 is what makes the gap retrievable after the fact. A log that recorded only the
answer would pass the same form check ('automatic event logs: present') while making post-market
monitoring blind to exactly the event it exists for. Form completeness over a log that cannot be
interrogated is the row-2 version of the finding in section 1.

LIMITS: timestamps are fixed and hashes are digests of frozen synthetic inputs, so the entry reproduces
byte for byte; the signer is a stand-in for a real key-management story this package does not provide.

8. FDA GMLP — TRANSPARENCY FOR SaMD (Table 7 row 5)
====================================================================================================

The clinical triage model is software as a medical device, and GMLP wants the design history file to
trace each requirement to its test and its artifact. The deployed engine keeps the single best proof;
exact inference is the pre-specified alternative sitting behind the PCCP boundary. Both are certified.

It reproduces the minimal evidence fields that one peer-reviewed review (Table 7 of the source named above) associates with the cited duty. Whether those fields discharge the duty, and whether the values supplied for them are accurate, are determinations this tool does not make and cannot make.

The chain is honest because the artifact fails the requirement it is filed under: VER-TRIAGE-07 demands
PASS, the deployed engine's certificate says FAIL, and the record carries that verdict instead of
re-running until something passes. A design history file that only ever contains passing artifacts is
not traceability, it is curation. The change-control field is the second half of the same discipline:
the PCCP boundary is stated as a measured delta — one stated reason versus five — not as a parameter
name, so a reviewer can see what the boundary costs the patient before deciding whether to cross it.

LIMITS: REQ/VER/PCCP identifiers are stand-ins for a real quality system; what transfers is that the
verification log and the change delta are measured by the certificate, not asserted about it.

Row 6 asks for risk evidence under continuous monitoring. The monitor is the machinery already shown:
one adverse action re-scored over six windows while the bureau's delinquency signal strengthens, a
certificate per window, and Table 19's coverage and stability as the monitored metrics. The thresholds are
declared before the run:

  coverage floor 0.5
  stability floor 0.8

the monitoring log, window by window:

  window 0: stated reason C01; coverage 0.2000 (floor 0.5); stability so far 1.0000 (floor 0.8)
  window 1: stated reason C01; coverage 0.2000 (floor 0.5); stability so far 1.0000 (floor 0.8)

    ATTRIBUTION: 3 reason(s) deleted, but they are not the 3 lowest-scoring reasons, so score-ordered top-k truncation does not explain the loss. Some other setting in the engine — proof search bound, pruning heuristic, or a defect — is dropping reasons the exact enumeration found.
    
    LIMITS OF THIS CERTIFICATE
      This certificate compares one engine's answer against exact inference on one ground program and one base interpretation. It is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. A PASS means no reason was shown to be deleted and the engine's value matched the exact value on this input; it does not certify the engine on any other input, and it does not establish that the reasons themselves are correct, only that the engine used all of the ones exact inference found.

LIMITS OF THIS RECORD
  This record is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It reproduces the minimal evidence fields that one peer-reviewed review (Table 7 of the source named above) associates with the cited duty. Whether those fields discharge the duty, and whether the values supplied for them are accurate, are determinations this tool does not make and cannot make.

Two alerts, two findings. The coverage alert fires at window 0: top-1 keeps one reason of five, so the
deployment was under the floor from the first check — continuous monitoring's first value is often showing
that a standing configuration was never within limits. The stability alert fires at window 2, when drift in
the bureau signal replaces the reason stated to the applicant; the rule drift report attached to the record
is that event's evidence.

The record is INCOMPLETE, and the missing field is the point. Reviews and sign-offs are a human act; a
frozen synthetic run has no reviewer, so the field is reported NOT PRODUCED rather than filled with a
simulated signature. A monitor that could mint its own sign-offs would make the register worthless.

LIMITS: the drift here is scripted — one signal on one frozen case — and the thresholds above are
illustrative, not recommended values. Real monitoring faces unscripted drift on data this does not have.

## 2. Conformance Report Output

Both runs below read
[`sample_decisions.jsonl`](../src/reasonsmith/examples/sample_decisions.jsonl), the committed
three-record decision trace from a credit-scoring pipeline. Neither run declares capabilities, so
both are read from that trace alone, and both reports say so on their face. Both do declare a
decision domain, `--system-domain consumer-credit`, because that is what the pipeline decides:
without it every duty limited to a domain is reported not applicable rather than checked, which is
the run in §2.2 below showing exactly that for a duty about medical-device software.

No trace holds that artefact and the enumeration is exact only on the one artefact it ran over, so the rungs above unattainable are recounted and probed, and neither observed nor proved is reachable however much the system exposes. Which of the two a verdict reaches is a fact about the artefact and not about the search: probed measures a reason set enumerated from a model encoding, recounted measures one the system recounted about its own inference.
    requires: artifact_logs_reason_explanation, artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    MISSING SIGNALS: artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count
    summary: Unattainable on the evidence supplied: no record in the supplied decision trace carries a value for artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count, and the system declared no capabilities, so nothing here can discharge this requirement. Read from that trace alone; a longer trace could show the system emitting these signals.

    requires: artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    MISSING SIGNALS: artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent
    summary: Unattainable on the evidence supplied: no record in the supplied decision trace carries a value for artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent, and the system declared no capabilities, so nothing here can discharge this requirement. Read from that trace alone; a longer trace could show the system emitting these signals.
  [NOT EVALUATED] ecoa_reg_b_1002_4_a_no_disparate_treatment (ECOA / Regulation B (12 CFR 1002.4) 12 CFR 1002.4(a)): inconclusive
    evidence basis: relational — this duty is a property of a pair of executions, and a decision record holds one. No length of decision log observes it, so the rungs it can reach are probed and proved; a system exposing only a log cannot discharge it, and that is a fact about the kind of property and not about how much the system exposed.
    requires: artifact_logs_decision_record, applicant_prohibited_basis
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    summary: Not evaluated: the system exposes no decide(), so there is no twin decision to run. A counterfactual is what the system would have decided, and a decision log records only what it did — no trace, however long, establishes one. Limit of this duty: it is invariance under one named variable holding all others fixed, so it is a property of treatment and says nothing about effects. A proxy is invisible to it — a rule set that never reads the protected variable and decides by postcode is satisfied here — and a disparate impact is not a thing it can find. It also reaches exactly one variable: a system answerable on several prohibited bases is answered here about the one this duty names.

LIMITS OF THIS REPORT
  This report is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It assesses system capability information and trace evidence against formal specifications. Whether these findings discharge legal duties remains a determination this tool does not make and cannot make. A requirement reported without a strength was not evaluated or is not applicable, and no verdict on it should be read from this report. Recital and guidance items inform how statutory duties are interpreted but create no obligation of their own; interpretive requirements are evaluated and reported separately, and are never folded into the binding headline counts. A requirement reported not applicable was excluded on one of two independent gates. Either no regulatory class was declared for the system at all, or the class that was declared is not the one the requirement is limited to; or no decision domain was declared for the system at all, or none of the domains that were declared is one the requirement is about. This tool infers neither the class nor the domain, so an undeclared system is neither placed in scope nor cleared of the duty: read the declared scope and domain lines before reading a not-applicable result. The decision-domain vocabulary is written by the pack author and by no regulation, and a duty declaring no domain reaches every system it is run against.

### 2.2 Table 7 pack — two rows discharged, three out of reach, one unattainable (exit code 0)

The same log checked against the Table 7 pack, which names Table 7's own evidence-field keys. This
trace carries the keys the GDPR Art. 22 and ECOA rows require, so those two are reported observed
over the three decisions in it — and observed is as far as a trace can carry them: read from that
trace alone, and not extended to decisions not in it. The two EU AI Act rows are limited to the
high-risk class and no scope was declared on the command line, so they are reported not applicable
— `reasonsmith` never infers that class. The FDA GMLP row is reported not applicable on the other
gate: it is a duty about `healthcare` decisions and this run declared `consumer-credit`, so the
duty does not reach this system and nothing about it was checked. The remaining interpretive row is
reported unattainable with its missing signals named, because the trace carries none of the keys it
requires and the run declared no capabilities. Nothing here is a breach, so the CLI exits 0.

Declaring the class with `--system-scope high-risk` is what brings the two EU AI Act rows into
scope and has them evaluated rather than set aside; that is the run behind the HTML page in
[`report.html`](report.html), which is built by `python docs/build_example.py` rather than by the CLI,
because it also carries the demonstration's key finding.

```sh
python -m reasonsmith.cli check --system src/reasonsmith/examples/sample_decisions.jsonl --pack table7 --system-name CreditScoringPipeline --system-domain consumer-credit

headline: 6 requirements · 4 binding: 2 observed, 2 not applicable · 2 interpretive: 1 unattainable, 1 not applicable

REQUIREMENT FINDINGS:
  [NOT APPLICABLE] eu_ai_act_art13_transparency (EU AI Act Art. 13): not_applicable
    requires: model_and_data_version_ids, extraction_timestamp, dataset_snapshot_hash, fidelity_coverage_metrics, explanation_scope, linkage_from_decision_to_artifact
    scope limit: high-risk
    summary: Not applicable: requirement scope is 'high-risk', but system regulatory class is undeclared. reasonsmith never infers a system's regulatory class.
  [NOT APPLICABLE] eu_ai_act_art12_record_keeping (EU AI Act Art. 12): not_applicable
    requires: automatic_event_logs, retention_schedule, signer
    scope limit: high-risk
    summary: Not applicable: requirement scope is 'high-risk', but system regulatory class is undeclared. reasonsmith never infers a system's regulatory class.
  [OBSERVED] gdpr_art22_meaningful_information (GDPR Art. 22 (and Rec. 71)): satisfied
    requires: per_decision_reason_string, feature_to_named_concept_mapping, dpia_cross_reference
    summary: Observed over 3 decision(s): every required signal (per_decision_reason_string, feature_to_named_concept_mapping, dpia_cross_reference) carries a value in every record. Holds on the trace supplied; nothing here extends the claim to decisions not in it.
  [OBSERVED] ecoa_reg_b_adverse_action (ECOA / Reg B 12 CFR 1002.9): satisfied
    requires: stored_reasons_per_decision, model_version, score_factors, audit_ids, retention_for_regulatory_lookback
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    summary: Observed over 3 decision(s): every required signal (stored_reasons_per_decision, model_version, score_factors, audit_ids, retention_for_regulatory_lookback) carries a value in every record. Holds on the trace supplied; nothing here extends the claim to decisions not in it.
  [NOT APPLICABLE] [INTERPRETIVE] fda_gmlp_samd (FDA GMLP agency transparency guidance): not_applicable
    requires: design_history_links, verification_logs, change_control
    domain limit: healthcare
    summary: Not applicable: this duty is about healthcare decisions, but the system's decision domain is declared as consumer-credit. reasonsmith never infers a system's decision domain, and the domain vocabulary is the pack author's rather than the regulation's — see docs/authoring-packs.md.
  [UNATTAINABLE] [INTERPRETIVE] nist_ai_rmf_risk_evidence (NIST AI RMF 1.0): inconclusive
    requires: continuous_monitoring_logs, metric_thresholds_and_alerts, reviews_and_sign_offs, incident_tickets
    MISSING SIGNALS: continuous_monitoring_logs, incident_tickets, metric_thresholds_and_alerts, reviews_and_sign_offs
    summary: Unattainable on the evidence supplied: no record in the supplied decision trace carries a value for continuous_monitoring_logs, incident_tickets, metric_thresholds_and_alerts, reviews_and_sign_offs, and the system declared no capabilities, so nothing here can discharge this requirement. Read from that trace alone; a longer trace could show the system emitting these signals.
