[![Reasonsmith conformance dossier: headline, key finding and reason audit with the four deleted reasons struck](docs/report-preview.png)](https://reasonsmith.dev/report.html)

## Prove which legally-owed reasons a system deleted. And from whom.

**For anyone who has to answer for an automated decision** — the team that built the model, the
auditor checking it, the regulator reading the file. reasonsmith checks a decision system against a
regulatory duty and states how it knows, instead of returning a tick.

A credit system declined application `APP-1042` and stated **one** reason. Its own inference used
**five**. reasonsmith re-ran that inference, switched each reason off in turn, and named the four
the system's answer depended on and its notice never said — and it did not read that from the
decision log, because the log records nothing missing.

Two commands, from a bare install, no checkout and no data of your own:

```sh
pip install reasonsmith
```

```sh
reasonsmith check --system-module reasonsmith.demo:deployed_credit_system --pack ecoa --system-name TruncatingCreditSystem

    evidence basis: artifact — this duty is measured against the inference artefact behind a decision rather than against what the system decided. No trace holds that artefact and the enumeration is exact only on the one artefact it ran over, so the rungs above unattainable are recounted and probed, and neither observed nor proved is reachable however much the system exposes. Which of the two a verdict reaches is a fact about the artefact and not about the search: probed measures a reason set enumerated from a model encoding, recounted measures one the system recounted about its own inference.
    requires: artifact_logs_reason_explanation, artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    summary: Violated on 1 of 2 certified decision(s): the stated reasons are not all the reasons. On decision #1 exact inference found 5 reason(s) and the deletion probe showed the system's answer does not depend on 4 of them — C05 — Insufficient number of credit references provided; C03 — Delinquent past or present credit obligations; C04 — Too many recent inquiries on credit bureau report; C02 — Length of time credit has been established is too short. Attribution: The deleted reasons are exactly the 4 lowest-scoring of the 5, and the engine kept the top 1. This is the signature of top-k proof truncation at k=1: top-k works by discarding proofs, so the dropped reasons are lost by configuration, not by error. The missing probability mass is 0.225799. Measured against the inference artefact the system exposed, not read from its decision log.
    offending record: decision APP-1042 (step 1)
    probe budget: 13 input(s) replayed, seed none — the proof enumeration and the deletion probes are deterministic, input space: decisions certified (2 values), decisions whose joint search did not finish (0 values), facts switched off (10 values), joint deletion patterns tried (1 values). Strategy: for each decision the system exposed an inference artefact for, its reasons are enumerated exactly by bounded proof enumeration over the ground program and scored by exact weighted model counting; every fact of a reason that no other reason uses is then switched off alone and the system's own engine re-run on the perturbed interpretation. A reason a single deletion moves the engine on is one its answer depends on. A reason no single deletion moves is then put to a second search, because two reasons jointly necessary and individually removable look exactly like two dropped ones: the subset-minimal *joint* deletions the engine notices are enumerated over the remaining facts, and a reason is counted here only where that enumeration ran to exhaustion and met no fact of it. The probe only ever switches a fact off, never on

    domain limit: consumer-credit
    MISSING SIGNALS: artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent
    summary: Unattainable as built: the system declares no capability to emit artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent, so no amount of testing can discharge this requirement. Determined from declared capabilities alone; the system was not executed.

    evidence basis: relational — this duty is a property of a pair of executions, and a decision record holds one. No length of decision log observes it, so the rungs it can reach are probed and proved; a system exposing only a log cannot discharge it, and that is a fact about the kind of property and not about how much the system exposed.
    requires: artifact_logs_decision_record, applicant_prohibited_basis
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    summary: Not evaluated: the system exposes no decide(), so there is no twin decision to run. A counterfactual is what the system would have decided, and a decision log records only what it did — no trace, however long, establishes one. Limit of this duty: it is invariance under one named variable holding all others fixed, so it is a property of treatment and says nothing about effects. A proxy is invisible to it — a rule set that never reads the protected variable and decides by postcode is satisfied here — and a disparate impact is not a thing it can find. It also reaches exactly one variable: a system answerable on several prohibited bases is answered here about the one this duty names.

LIMITS OF THIS REPORT
  This report is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It assesses system capability information and trace evidence against formal specifications. Whether these findings discharge legal duties remains a determination this tool does not make and cannot make. A requirement reported without a strength was not evaluated or is not applicable, and no verdict on it should be read from this report. Recital and guidance items inform how statutory duties are interpreted but create no obligation of their own; interpretive requirements are evaluated and reported separately, and are never folded into the binding headline counts. A requirement reported not applicable was excluded on one of two independent gates. Either no regulatory class was declared for the system at all, or the class that was declared is not the one the requirement is limited to; or no decision domain was declared for the system at all, or none of the domains that were declared is one the requirement is about. This tool infers neither the class nor the domain, so an undeclared system is neither placed in scope nor cleared of the duty: read the declared scope and domain lines before reading a not-applicable result. The decision-domain vocabulary is written by the pack author and by no regulation, and a duty declaring no domain reaches every system it is run against.
```

**Form completeness does not imply reason fidelity.** 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2) asks two things of an
adverse-action notice, and this repository ships them as two duties. `..._specific_reasons` reads
the notice's **form**: a statement of reasons is there, and it is none of the wordings the clause
itself calls insufficient. `..._principal_reasons_complete` reads its **content**: are the reasons
stated all the reasons the decision's own inference used? On `APP-1042` the first comes back
**satisfied** and the second comes back **violated** — which is the finding, not an inconsistency.
Checking form alone launders that gap into a document that reads as authoritative: on this same
decision the Table 7 evidence record is `COMPLETE`, and it is the reason-deletion certificate
beneath it that reads `FAIL`. That record, that certificate and the four struck reasons are in
[`docs/example-output.md`](docs/example-output.md).

The same violation ships as an example you can run without the CLI, alongside three that pass:

```sh
python -m reasonsmith.examples.truncating_credit_system
```

**Before you go further, the four things this tool cannot do** — it takes a system's word about what
it is, three quarters of the shipped duties are presence checks, a rung is not a grade, and the
strongest results need a system that exposes its inference: [`docs/what-this-does-not-do.md`](docs/what-this-does-not-do.md).
Every claim there cites the committed document that already states it, with the numbers.

## One run, five readers

The block above is one rendering of that run, not the only one. `--audience` renders the *same*
run for a named reader — five ship: `developer`, `deployer`, `auditor`, `regulator`,
`affected-individual` — and **it changes what is shown, never what is claimed**. Nothing is
recomputed per reader: every part of every view is a part of the single report the run already
produced. No reader is shown a verdict another reader is not shown, no reader loses the limits
section, and dropping the flag renders the full report — which is the auditor's view, by identity,
so the transcript above is already one of the five.

Here is that run for a **regulator**. Same five verdicts, same strengths, different content: every
`requires:` line is gone, and the `domain limit:` line that decides whether the duty reaches this
system at all stays. A regulator's question is how far a claim reaches, so the probe budget stays
too; the internal signal names and — on a run that produces them — the trace witnesses holding real
applicants' records do not.

And the same run for the **person the decision was about** — the narrowest artefact this tool
renders, and the only one that is *derived* rather than narrowed. It carries no system internals
at all: no signal names, no probe budget, no counterexamples, and no strength vocabulary, because
being told a duty is `probed` hands a person this tool's evidence model instead of an answer. What
it carries instead is the part of this same run no other view says out loud — the decision the
system recorded and the reason it stated, in its own words, and the reasons the certificate engine
measured it used and did not state.

WHAT THE SYSTEM RECORDED ABOUT THE 2 DECISIONS IT LOGGED
    the decision it recorded: "adverse action on APP-1043"

WHETHER THOSE WERE ALL THE REASONS
    4 further reason(s) the system's own answer depended on were not stated. Measured by re-running its inference, not inferred from its log:
    "C05 — Insufficient number of credit references provided"

**What that view is still not: an adverse-action notice.** Everything above is the system's own
words and the engines' own measurements, quoted — the log said this, the certificate found these
four reasons went unstated — and not one sentence of it paraphrases the statute, explains the
decision, or advises. A conformance report does not hold the adverse-action statement a creditor
owes a person and this projection will not write one. Where a run has less to quote it says so
rather than going quiet: a run that read no decision record says that, and a run where nothing
measured whether the stated reasons were complete says *that*, because silence there reads as a
clean result to the reader least equipped to know otherwise. The full row-by-row table of what
each of the five readers is shown — authored here, not derived from the law, so it can be argued
with — is in [`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §7.

`--audience` projects the text and HTML renderings only. `--json` stays the complete machine
record, so a pipeline never loses fields to a display flag — and so `--audience
affected-individual --json` is not a redaction. Redaction is a security property; this is a
presentation one. The decision accounts the lay view quotes are the one thing not in it, for the
opposite reason: the JSON is the findings record, and what the system logged is an input the run
read rather than a finding it made.

## Any model in: one duty, three systems, three rungs

The run above held one system fixed and varied the property, so it answers **what a property actually says**. This section does the opposite — one duty, three systems — so it answers **how far a claim reaches**. Two different questions about the same tool; neither answers the other, which is why both are on this page.

Neural, probabilistic or symbolic — a system is fed in by writing an adapter that says what it exposes, and what kind of decision it makes. These three, all checked against the *same* binding duty (ECOA / Reg B 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2), "the statement of reasons ... must be specific"), come back at three different rungs:

| system | what it exposes | rung reached |
|---|---|---|
| [neural risk network](src/reasonsmith/examples/neural_scorer.py), served behind an inference API | `decisions()` — an exported decision log, nothing else | `observed` |
| [probabilistic log-odds scorer](src/reasonsmith/examples/probabilistic_scorer.py), in-process | `decisions()` + `decide(case)` replay | `probed`, carrying its search budget |
| [symbolic underwriting rule set](src/reasonsmith/examples/symbolic_rules.py) | `decisions()` + `logic()` | `proved`, over every input the constraints admit |

All three also declare `system_domains = ("consumer-credit",)`, which is what puts them inside a duty about adverse-action reasons at all: 12 CFR 1002.9 is about consumer-credit decisions, and a system that has declared no decision domain is reported *not applicable* rather than judged. Raising a rung means changing the *system*; declaring a domain it is not in would be a different error entirely.

These three systems ship *inside* the package, so the commands below run against a
`pip install reasonsmith` with no checkout and no data of your own:

```sh
for s in neural_scorer probabilistic_scorer symbolic_rules; do python -m reasonsmith.examples.$s; done
```

The CLI reaches the same three systems against a whole pack, no Python needed — `--system-module` **imports the named module, which executes it**, and takes the attribute after the colon as the system under test (the `module:attribute` spelling pytest's `-p` and gunicorn's application path use):

```sh
reasonsmith check --system-module reasonsmith.examples.symbolic_rules:system_under_test --pack ecoa
```

All three verdicts here are `satisfied` — the shipped example that comes back **violated** is the truncating credit system of the first section — and the rung is what separates these three: how far each claim reaches — three logged decisions, 200 replayed inputs, or every input the declared constraints admit. The neural system **cannot** reach `probed` or `proved` as built, and no adapter can change that; a test pins that ceiling. Full walkthrough, with the three transcripts and why this duty was chosen over a recital: [`docs/three-systems.md`](docs/three-systems.md).

A further system — [a language model prompted to write the notice](src/reasonsmith/examples/language_model_notices.py) — adds no rung: a model you can call sits at `probed`, where the probabilistic scorer already sits. It is worth a document of its own for the *other* axis, which duties can be answered about a system at all. Run against the whole `ecoa` pack it comes back `observed` on the notice's timing and contents, `probed` on 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2)'s specific-reasons duty, and **`unattainable`** on the other half of that same clause, naming the signal it lacks — because reason fidelity is measured from an inference artefact and a decoder has none. reasonsmith refuses that duty rather than passing the system on the easier one beside it: [`docs/language-model.md`](docs/language-model.md).

## The state of the art, the gap, and what this adds

**Where compliance tooling stands.** Checking an automated decision system against a regulatory duty is, in practice, checking a document. Model cards, datasheets, audit-log schemas, the EU AI Act's own Article 12 record-keeping duty: each names artefacts the system must produce, and a checker reads what was produced and reports which required fields are filled. That is a real check and it catches real gaps — a missing reason field is a missing reason field.

**The gap.** Existing compliance tools check whether a log has the required fields. None of them states what *strength of evidence* stands behind the verdict. A checker reading a decision log can speak only about the decisions in that log; a checker reasoning over a system's decision rules can speak about every input those rules admit. Both report the same word. The reader of the report cannot tell which one happened, so a claim about three logged decisions and a claim about an unbounded input space arrive indistinguishable — and the weaker of the two is the one that is easy to produce.

**What reasonsmith adds.** Every verdict carries the method that reached it, on a strict lattice — `unattainable < observed < recounted < probed < proved` — and a result no engine could establish carries no strength at all rather than a satisfied verdict. Which rung a duty reaches is a fact about the system under test, not about which word a pack author typed: the same property is read off a trace, searched by replay, or proved by a solver depending only on what the system exposes. `RequirementResult` refuses to be constructed claiming more than it has, so the bound travels into every rendering instead of being a convention some renderer might drop. The three-systems table above is that claim under test — one duty, three systems, three different rungs — rather than an illustration of it.

**What this does not claim.** A rung is not a compliance grade and not a confidence score: it ranks how a conclusion was reached, never what it was reached about, so a `proved` verdict over logic unrelated to the deployed system is worth less than an `observed` verdict over a year of production decisions, and the lattice cannot see that. Nothing here determines whether a legal duty is discharged. The full statement of what each rung does and does not mean, one engine at a time, is [`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md).

### The two concrete questions

Given a decision, the symbolic artifact behind it, and an applicable duty, reasonsmith answers:

1. **Is the evidence record complete?** Does it carry every field the duty's formal specification requires?
2. **Did the explanation engine keep the reasons it was supposed to give?** Or did it drop some on the way out?

The first is evaluated against the formal specification and reported with its strength. The second compares actual engine behavior against ground-truth exact inference: where the applicable requirement identifies reasons the statute obliges, its paired reason-deletion certificate shows which of them the engine dropped. Where the system exposes the inference artefact behind a decision, that certificate is itself an engine, so the second question is answered as a requirement verdict rather than alongside one.

## What a verdict is worth

Every evaluated result records its evidence strength, on one lattice:

- `unattainable` — on a declared basis, signals the duty needs are outside the system's declared capability set; on a trace basis, no supplied record carries them, which does not establish that the system cannot emit them. Computed without executing the system; the missing signals are named.
- `observed` — read off the decision trace supplied; it claims nothing about decisions outside it.
- `probed` — a bounded search, never a proof: the engine perturbs the decisions the system has already made, replays each generated input through the system itself, reports any counterexample it finds within the budget and otherwise reports that none was found, naming exactly what was searched.
- `proved` — a solver result: the decision logic the system exposes is checked over every input the declared constraints admit, and a counterexample is executed before it is reported as a violation.

Combining zero verdicts is `inconclusive`, never vacuously `satisfied`. A requirement no engine here can evaluate is reported with no strength, rather than judged by a weaker check. What each verdict means — and does not mean — is stated one engine at a time in [`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md); every soundness claim there names the test that fails if the claim becomes false.

How each shipped requirement got from a clause of law to a formula — and, in a fourth column, what that refinement deliberately did not capture — is recorded in [`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md), one row per requirement across all five packs.

## Can it use a different formalism? Engines and packs install

Seven engines ship here, but the set is not closed. An engine is discovered through the
`reasonsmith.engines` entry-point group and a pack through `reasonsmith.packs`, so a Prolog, ASP or
other-solver engine — and a regulation pack this repository does not carry — ships as *your* pip
package and joins the run the moment it is installed, with no pull request here. The property
language does not change: a plug-in engine is handed the same requirement in the same language the
built-ins get. What opens is which engine may discharge a duty, and nothing else. A plug-in cannot
report above the `max_strength` it declares, one that raises, will not import or returns the wrong
type is reported *not evaluated* rather than satisfied, and every plug-in result names its plug-in.
There is no wall clock, so a plug-in that hangs hangs the run — and nothing here audits a plug-in,
so a `proved` from an engine this repository never saw is worth the installer's trust in that
package and no more. What to supply, and what that trust does and does not
buy: [`docs/authoring-engines.md`](docs/authoring-engines.md).

## Automated Conformance Checking

A decision log is the commonest system and the weakest: it exposes no inference artefact, so the same pack that reported the adequacy duty *violated* above reports it *unattainable* here, naming the signal nothing in the log could supply — never returning it to the presence check. The committed sample log ships with the package, and `python -m reasonsmith.examples` prints the directory it was installed into, so this runs against the same pack with no data of your own:

```sh
reasonsmith check --system "$(python -m reasonsmith.examples)/sample_decisions.jsonl" --pack ecoa --system-name CreditScoringPipeline --system-domain consumer-credit
```

```text

    evidence basis: artifact — this duty is measured against the inference artefact behind a decision rather than against what the system decided. No trace holds that artefact and the enumeration is exact only on the one artefact it ran over, so the rungs above unattainable are recounted and probed, and neither observed nor proved is reachable however much the system exposes. Which of the two a verdict reaches is a fact about the artefact and not about the search: probed measures a reason set enumerated from a model encoding, recounted measures one the system recounted about its own inference.
    requires: artifact_logs_reason_explanation, artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    MISSING SIGNALS: artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count
    summary: Unattainable on the evidence supplied: no record in the supplied decision trace carries a value for artifact_logs_deleted_reason_count, and the system declared no capabilities, so nothing here can discharge this requirement. Read from that trace alone; a longer trace could show the system emitting these signals.
  [UNATTAINABLE] ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_c_2_incompleteness_notice_runs_out (ECOA / Regulation B (12 CFR 1002.9) 12 CFR 1002.9(c)(2)): inconclusive

    MISSING SIGNALS: artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent
    summary: Unattainable on the evidence supplied: no record in the supplied decision trace carries a value for artifact_logs_incompleteness_notice_sent, and the system declared no capabilities, so nothing here can discharge this requirement. Read from that trace alone; a longer trace could show the system emitting these signals.
  [NOT EVALUATED] ecoa_reg_b_1002_4_a_no_disparate_treatment (ECOA / Regulation B (12 CFR 1002.4) 12 CFR 1002.4(a)): inconclusive
    evidence basis: relational — this duty is a property of a pair of executions, and a decision record holds one. No length of decision log observes it, so the rungs it can reach are probed and proved; a system exposing only a log cannot discharge it, and that is a fact about the kind of property and not about how much the system exposed.
    requires: artifact_logs_decision_record, applicant_prohibited_basis
    domain limit: consumer-credit
    summary: Not evaluated: the system exposes no decide(), so there is no twin decision to run. A counterfactual is what the system would have decided, and a decision log records only what it did — no trace, however long, establishes one. Limit of this duty: it is invariance under one named variable holding all others fixed, so it is a property of treatment and says nothing about effects. A proxy is invisible to it — a rule set that never reads the protected variable and decides by postcode is satisfied here — and a disparate impact is not a thing it can find. It also reaches exactly one variable: a system answerable on several prohibited bases is answered here about the one this duty names.

LIMITS OF THIS REPORT
  This report is not a compliance guarantee and is not legal advice. It assesses system capability information and trace evidence against formal specifications. Whether these findings discharge legal duties remains a determination this tool does not make and cannot make. A requirement reported without a strength was not evaluated or is not applicable, and no verdict on it should be read from this report. Recital and guidance items inform how statutory duties are interpreted but create no obligation of their own; interpretive requirements are evaluated and reported separately, and are never folded into the binding headline counts. A requirement reported not applicable was excluded on one of two independent gates. Either no regulatory class was declared for the system at all, or the class that was declared is not the one the requirement is limited to; or no decision domain was declared for the system at all, or none of the domains that were declared is one the requirement is about. This tool infers neither the class nor the domain, so an undeclared system is neither placed in scope nor cleared of the duty: read the declared scope and domain lines before reading a not-applicable result. The decision-domain vocabulary is written by the pack author and by no regulation, and a duty declaring no domain reaches every system it is run against.
```

`observed` is the weakest rung of the strength lattice that can still say a property held: it is read off the trace supplied and claims nothing about decisions outside it. `--system-domain consumer-credit` is what puts this log inside 12 CFR 1002.9 at all: those duties are about consumer-credit decisions, and a system that declares no decision domain has them reported not applicable rather than checked. The same log checked against the Table 7 pack still exits 0, because nothing there is a breach: the GDPR Art. 22 and ECOA rows come back observed, the NIST row comes back unattainable with its missing signals named, the FDA GMLP row comes back not applicable because it is about healthcare decisions, and the two EU AI Act rows come back not applicable against an undeclared regulatory scope — declaring it with `--system-scope high-risk` is what brings them into scope, and that is the run behind the dossier at [reasonsmith.dev/report.html](https://reasonsmith.dev/report.html). See [`docs/example-output.md`](docs/example-output.md) for that run and for the full 905-line demo transcript, both stdout pasted unedited.

## Quick Start

1. Install the published package. This puts the `reasonsmith` command on your PATH, with `python -m reasonsmith.cli` staying available:

```sh
pip install reasonsmith
```

2. Run the shipped demonstration:

```sh
python -m reasonsmith.demo
```

The demonstration runs on frozen synthetic data included in the package. It needs no input file or source checkout and prints the complete demonstration, including the `NOT PRODUCED` reasoning and `LIMITS` sections.

3. Audit your own decision log against a regulation pack:

```sh
reasonsmith check --system /path/to/your-decisions.jsonl --pack gdpr --html report.html
```

`check` runs one of the five shipped packs (Table 7, EU AI Act (Art. 12 & 13), GPAI (EU AI Act Art. 53 & 55), GDPR, ECOA/Reg B) against your JSONL decision log, printing the report as text, JSON (`--json`), or a self-contained HTML report (`--html FILE`). It exits 2 when a requirement is violated, 1 on a usage or input error, and 0 otherwise.

A decision log exposes neither `decide()` nor `logic()`, so a `--system` run cannot rise above `observed`. To check the system itself, name an adapter instead:

```sh
reasonsmith check --system-module your_package.audit:system_under_test --pack gdpr
```

**`--system-module` imports the named module, which executes it**, and takes the attribute after the colon — a `SystemUnderTest` or a zero-argument factory returning one — as the system under test. The module is searched from the current directory. It refuses `--system` and `--capabilities`, which name a different system and speak for a log's adapter respectively. Three worked examples: [`docs/three-systems.md`](docs/three-systems.md).

Contributors and developers install from source instead, running the full verification suite and demonstration from the checkout:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eduardstan/reasonsmith.git
cd reasonsmith
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
ruff check .
pytest
python -m reasonsmith.demo
reasonsmith check --system src/reasonsmith/examples/sample_decisions.jsonl --pack ecoa --system-domain consumer-credit
```

Every command in the source block runs from a fresh clone in that order; the `ecoa` run above exits 0.

*Note:* This source install is the one CI itself runs (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Full empirical environment measurements and torch test counts are documented in **[RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md)**.

## Where the Duties Come From

The duty-to-artifact mapping is Table 7 of *Symbols and Neurons: A Review of Symbolic XAI in Deep Learning* (Stan, Sciavicco & Napoletano, JAIR 2026, p. 36:22), reviewing 273 primary studies across five regulatory frameworks: EU AI Act, GDPR, ECOA/Reg B, FDA GMLP, and NIST AI RMF.

Table 7 is transcribed verbatim into `src/reasonsmith/table7.toml`. That file is data, not code: every duty records its row number, and every machine key sits next to the exact cell text it stands for. `traceability_report()` prints the table side by side. Where a design decision and Table 7 disagree, Table 7 wins. Statutory texts are backed by retrieval records in [`docs/legal-sources.md`](docs/legal-sources.md).

### Core Components

- **The Emitter (`evidence.py`):** `emit(duty_id, decision_id, fields)` returns a record that is either `COMPLETE` or `INCOMPLETE`. An `INCOMPLETE` record explicitly names the fields it lacks. Nothing is defaulted, inferred, or silently dropped. Keys outside the duty's Table 7 row are rejected, and non-Table 7 data is isolated in `attachments`.
- **The Reason-Deletion Certificate (`certificate.py`):** Compares the reasons an engine actually used against exact inference ground truth (enumerated via WMC in `nesyarena`). Using deletion probes, it tests whether disabling isolated facts changes engine output. Two independent checks must pass: the deletion probe (every reason live) and the value check against the exact oracle. A reason no *single* deletion moves is not thereby deleted — two reasons jointly necessary and individually removable look exactly like two dropped ones — so every candidate is decided against the subset-minimal *joint* deletions the engine notices, and is reported `deleted` only where that enumeration ran to exhaustion and met no fact of it. That object is defined before it is measured, in [`docs/sufficient-reasons.md`](docs/sufficient-reasons.md): the abductive explanation and its contrastive dual of the published formal-XAI literature, specialised to the deletions an artefact admits. A search that runs out of budget reports its unresolved reasons `undetermined`, so a shorter search names fewer missing reasons and never more. Reasons that cannot be probed in isolation are reported as uncertified (`INCONCLUSIVE`). It is reachable from a conformance run: **the Certificate Engine (`engines/certificate.py`)** runs it over the inference artefact a system exposes through the optional `artifact(decision)` hook, measures the deleted-reason count itself rather than reading one the system logged, and discharges `ecoa_reg_b_1002_9_b_2_principal_reasons_complete` at strength `probed` — a system exposing no artefact is reported `unattainable` on that duty and never downgraded to the presence check on the reason field. What an artefact *is* belongs to reasonsmith and not to any representation: **`artifacts.InferenceArtifact`** states what a reason-bearing artefact must expose and whether its inference is **monotone in its facts**, a nesyarena ground program is one adapter satisfying it, and an artefact that declares its inference non-monotone — or declares nothing, or is contradicted by the probe — is reported *not evaluated* rather than measured with a definition of "reason" that does not apply to it. See [`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §3, *certificate* and *The inference artefact*.
- **The Conformance Core (`verdict.py`, `report.py`):** Every evaluated result records its evidence strength: `unattainable < observed < recounted < probed < proved`. `unattainable` is a set difference over SUT capabilities computed without running the system: with declared capabilities it describes the system, while with trace-derived capabilities it describes only the supplied records; either way, the missing signals are named. `observed` evaluates passive decision traces. `probed` actively replays perturbed inputs. `proved` is a solver result. A requirement no engine here can evaluate is reported as not evaluated — no strength and no satisfied-or-violated conclusion — rather than judged by a weaker check. Combining zero verdicts is `inconclusive`, never vacuously `satisfied`. Every requirement's `spec` is a formula in one property language (`rulelang.py`), and `formalism` names which fragment it belongs to: `record` (a conjunction of `present(signal)` atoms), `temporal` (a formula using a temporal operator), `logical` (any other property of one decision record), `counterfactual` (the one relational atom, a property of a *pair* of executions, which is the whole of a spec or no part of one), and the two open-texture fragments `undetermined` and `graded`, for predicates the law states without a sharp boundary — the first names the authority that settles the predicate, the second carries a truth degree over an algebra the pack declares, and both are reported *not evaluated* because neither turns a word like *meaningful* into a verdict (`docs/semantics.md` §9). The fragment says what the property *is*; **what discharges it is a fact about the system**, not about the pack — the same presence property is `observed` against a trace, `probed` against a system exposing `decide()`, and `proved` against one exposing `logic()`. See `docs/semantics.md` §3.5. Beside the strength, every result records its **evidence basis** — what kind of thing the evidence is *about*, as against how far the claim was pushed. It is a classification and never a rank: `behavioural` (the system's executions, one at a time) reaches every rung, `relational` (a pair of executions) can never be `observed`, `artifact` (the inference behind a decision) reaches `probed` and no higher, and `assessment` (an open-textured predicate a named authority applies) reaches no rung at all. Two bases do not compare — the comparison raises rather than answering. The lattice has gained exactly one member since, and the same distinction decided that it should: `recounted` is evidence about the *same* object as `artifact`, reached less deeply — a reason set the system recounted rather than one enumerated from a model encoding — so it is a rung on that row and not a fifth basis. A duty's ceiling is therefore reported as the *duty's* rather than as something the system failed to expose. See `docs/semantics.md` §10.
- **The Proved Engine (`engines/proved.py`):** `logical` requirements are discharged by Z3 against the decision logic a system exposes through `sut.logic()` — its variables, its rules, the constraints its inputs are known to obey, and which of those variables it *computes*. That last declaration is what separates an input the decision situation supplies from an output the system produces, and a property naming something in neither — a name the system has no notion of — is refused a proof rather than answered from a constant the solver invented. Rules are encoded in static single assignment form, so a rule that reassigns a name means what it means when executed. Three things are refused rather than reported: logic or a property using a construct the encoding does not model, a solver result of `unknown` or a timeout, and premises no input can satisfy — an over-constrained model makes `unsat` prove every property alike, so it counts as no evidence, not as proof. When the solver finds a counterexample, that input is executed before anything is reported: `VIOLATED` at strength `proved` is only claimed once the violation reproduces, and the evidence summary names what it reproduced against, since a system exposing only `logic()` can be replayed only through its declared logic and not through itself. The GDPR pack ships the first `logical` requirement proved against real statute: `gdpr_art22_1_no_prohibited_decision_for_any_input` asks Z3 whether the exposed rules admit any input on which a decision is solely automated and significantly affecting while no Article 22(2) basis applies and the Article 22(3) route to human intervention is closed. That duty is universal, so a record check over a supplied trace cannot express it; a `proved` verdict here is a statement about the exposed rules over every input the declared constraints admit, and the pack's description says so in full — it is not a determination that the controller has discharged Article 22.
- **The Probed Engine (`engines/probed.py`):** The rung for a system whose decision logic cannot be inspected. A `logical` requirement against a system that exposes `decide()` but no `logic()` is searched rather than proved: the engine takes the decisions the system has already made, perturbs their fields — over the values the trace shows, the property's own numeric thresholds and their neighbours — and replays each generated input through the system itself. A counterexample is replayed a second time before it is reported, and one that does not reproduce is a defect in the search, so it is reported not evaluated rather than as a violation. No counterexample within the budget is `probed`, never `proved`: the verdict carries what was searched — how many inputs were replayed, the strategy, the seed, and the fields the search could vary — and `RequirementResult` refuses to be constructed without it, so no rendering can drop it. The same seed replays the same inputs in the same order, so a reported budget can be re-derived. Defaults are 200 replayed inputs at seed 0, both configurable.
- **Binding vs interpretive duties, regulatory scope and decision domain:** Each requirement records whether it is a legally binding duty or an interpretive recital/guidance item, any regulatory class it is limited to, and the kinds of decision it is about. The headline names both halves — `6 requirements · 4 binding: 2 observed, 2 unattainable · 2 interpretive: 2 observed` — so an interpretive item is reported without being counted as compliance evidence. A class-limited requirement is checked only against a system declared to be in that class via `--system-scope`; the class is never inferred, so an undeclared system has those requirements reported not applicable. Classes come from one fixed vocabulary — `prohibited`, `high-risk`, `limited-risk`, `minimal-risk`, `general-purpose` — which both a pack's `scope` and a declared `--system-scope` are checked against, after trimming whitespace and lowercasing and with nothing else guessed. A value outside it is a usage error naming what would have been accepted, so a misspelling on either side cannot become a duty that quietly never matches. A class the vocabulary knows but the chosen pack does not target is not an error: those duties are reported not applicable as a declared mismatch. `domains` is a second gate on a different axis, working the same way through `--system-domain` (repeat it for a system that makes more than one kind of decision) and matched by intersection, so one shared domain is enough; a duty declaring no domain reaches every system. One difference matters more than the mechanism: `REGULATORY_CLASSES` is the EU AI Act's own vocabulary, but no statute defines a list of decision domains, so `DECISION_DOMAINS` is written in this repository. A pack limiting a duty to a domain must say so in its description, and a not-applicable verdict on that gate reports a classification a pack author made rather than a finding about a statute's reach ([`docs/authoring-packs.md`](docs/authoring-packs.md), *the decision-domain vocabulary is yours, not the regulation's*).
- **The CLI (`cli.py`):** Five packs ship — Table 7, EU AI Act (Art. 12 & 13), GPAI (EU AI Act Art. 53 & 55), GDPR, ECOA/Reg B — and the CLI runs one against a JSONL decision log. It is installed as the `reasonsmith` command (`pip install reasonsmith`) and stays runnable as `python -m reasonsmith.cli`:

  ```sh
  reasonsmith check --system /path/to/your-decisions.jsonl --pack ecoa --system-domain consumer-credit
  reasonsmith check --system /path/to/your-decisions.jsonl --pack eu_ai_act --system-scope high-risk --html report.html
  reasonsmith validate-pack ecoa eu_ai_act gpai gdpr table7
  reasonsmith --version
  ```

  `check` exits 2 when a requirement is violated, 1 on a usage or input error, and 0 otherwise. Unattainable, not applicable and not evaluated are findings to read in the report, not breaches, so none of them changes the exit code. Reports render to plain text, structured JSON (`--json`), or a self-contained offline HTML report (`--html FILE`). By default the CLI reads capabilities from the supplied log, and a result resting on that says so rather than speaking for the system; pass `--capabilities /path/to/capabilities.txt` to instead have the system's maintainers declare what it can emit. The file has one signal name per line; blank lines and whole-line comments whose first nonblank character is `#` are ignored. The report then says the capabilities were declared. An empty declaration file declares nothing, which is a distinct claim from having no declaration at all, and a malformed line is refused naming the file and the line. `--audience {developer,deployer,auditor,regulator,affected-individual}` projects the text and HTML
renderings for one reader, changing what is shown and never what is claimed; omitted, the full
report is printed. `--json` is deliberately not projected, and its envelope carries a
`schema_version` integer — `1` today — so a consumer can tell one release's shape from another's.
It is not the package version: it increments when a key is removed, renamed, or changes type or
meaning, and stays put when a key is merely added, so a parser reading the keys it knows is never
broken by a version it has not seen. `validate-pack` validates one or more
requirement packs and prints what each contains, exiting 0 for any packs a `check` run could load and 1 at the first one the loader refuses, naming the file and the requirement at fault; the authoring guide is [`docs/authoring-packs.md`](docs/authoring-packs.md). `validate-pack --analyse` additionally checks a pack against *itself* — whether its requirements are jointly satisfiable, which of them entail or are equivalent to which (the EU AI Act Article 12(1)/12(2) overlap is reported without anyone reading the TOML), and which are vacuously discharged; with the `ltlf` extra installed it also decides the temporal duties as finite-trace formulas, which is the only way the one shipped `until` duty is reached at all; with `--system-module` it also scores each duty against single-point mutants of that system's declared rules, which reaches only a system exposing its rules and is not a coverage number. Findings do not change the exit code. [`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §8 states what each answer means.
- **Machine-Readable & Visual HTML Output:** Records, certificates, and reports serialize to dicts (`to_dict()`), JSON (`to_json(indent=None)`), and self-contained HTML (`render_html()`). Each carries the same facts as its text rendering, including its missing-field report and its own limits, so a downstream consumer cannot read a partial document as a complete one. Values outside JSON's own types are stringified rather than raising. Conformance results need no serializer: `group_stats()` and `stratified()` already return plain dicts of JSON-native types, so `json.dumps(stratified(groups))` is the whole recipe — and an unmeasured metric serialises as `null`, never `0`. The HTML report opens from any `file://` path with zero network dependencies, presents the evidence strength lattice, splits binding vs interpretive duties, highlights counterexample trace witnesses for violations, and visually distinguishes unattainable architectural gaps from runtime violations.
- **The Statute Drift Check (`drift.py`):** A maintenance check, not a conformance engine. `python -m reasonsmith.drift` re-fetches each official statutory document recorded in [`docs/legal-sources.md`](docs/legal-sources.md) and compares the packs' `verbatim_text` against the live source, collapsing only whitespace (the one thing a printer legitimately changes). Every requirement is `match`, `differ` (both strings named) or `could-not-verify` (the source is unreachable or no longer carries the passage — never a pass), and a pack is never edited automatically. `.github/workflows/statute-drift.yml` runs it on the first of every month and files a single GitHub issue when anything drifts; the tests run the same check against recorded byte-faithful fixture slices, so the suite needs no network.
- **Dependencies & PyPI:** `reasonsmith` is published on PyPI — `pip install reasonsmith` is the user install, and the [PyPI project page](https://pypi.org/project/reasonsmith/) always lists the current release. `nesyarena` supplies ground-program IR, proof enumeration, and exact WMC (pinned to `nesyarena==0.1.0` on PyPI in `pyproject.toml`); `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in a venv is the contributor install, pulling the dev tooling in with the source checkout. `rtamt`, which supplies STL temporal monitoring, and `z3-solver`, which supplies the SMT solver behind the proved engine, are declared runtime dependencies of `reasonsmith`, both pinned exactly. `reasonsmith[ltlf]` is the one **optional extra**: it installs the finite-trace decision procedure `validate-pack --analyse` puts temporal duties to ([`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §8). Nothing in `check`, in any engine or in any shipped example touches it, so `pip install reasonsmith` stays the two-command demo above; with the extra absent the analysis says so and answers no temporal question from a weaker substitute. `torch`, by contrast, is an optional dependency of `nesyarena` (~1GB) and is deliberately not a declared dependency of `reasonsmith` — it was installed and measured in a separate environment, recorded in [RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md).

### Summary of Empirical Findings

| Metric / Finding | Observed Result | Rationale & Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| **Stratified Checks (Design A: Confidence Varies)** | Coverage gap: 0.0000<br>Fidelity gap: +0.0535<br>Retained share gap: +0.2802 | Top-k proof truncation keeps fixed proof count regardless of confidence scaling. Coverage remains identical across groups; retained share catches the atypical group's loss of value. |
| **Stratified Checks (Design B: Reason Multiplicity Varies)** | Coverage gap: +0.3000<br>Fidelity gap: +0.1472<br>Retained share gap: +0.1129 | Cases with more reasons suffer lower coverage under fixed k=1 truncation (a case with 5 reasons retains 1/5th; a case with 2 retains 1/2). |
| **Signal Stability (Drift across windows)** | Stability score: 0.3333 | Under top-1 settings, drift in a single signal silently swaps the stated reason across windows on an unchanged applicant file. |

The stratified rows are measured on frozen synthetic cohorts, built to separate the two mechanisms from each other. Whether real atypical cases trip more reasons than typical ones is an empirical question about data this table does not have, and the table does not answer it. Every figure in it is reproduced in **[RESULTS.md](RESULTS.md)**, along with the exact environment and versions, both suites' pass/fail/skip counts with `torch` installed, and a byte-for-byte diff of two demo runs.

Figures this README takes from the paper rather than from running code — the 273 primary studies, the six Table 7 duties — and the rough `~1GB` size of the `torch` download are not measurements and are not reproduced there.

## Who could use this, and what is missing first

Four groups this work is aimed at, and — for each — what is missing before the tool is usable to
them. These are gaps, not wishes: every one is stated in a committed document, cited here. A reader
from one of these groups should be able to recognise their own blocker.

*Not the same list as `--audience`, and deliberately kept apart.* The five audiences above are
**readers of one report**: a projection of a rendering, which ships, works today, and has nothing to
do with whether the tool is usable to anyone. The four below are **parties who might adopt the
project**, each with a blocker that is not a rendering. They share two words and neither list
refines the other — an insurer is a kind of buyer, an affected individual is a kind of reader, and a
regulator appears on both while meaning something different on each. Merging them would have to
either invent an adoption blocker for `developer` and `affected-individual`, which no committed
document states and this page may not manufacture, or drop `insurers`, who read no report at all.



**Insurers** pricing exposure on an automated decision system. Missing: a claim that survives past
the trace, for most systems and most duties. `observed` covers exactly the records supplied and
establishes nothing about decisions outside them. One escape now exists and is narrow on both axes:
an `always(f)` whose `f` is a property of one decision is proved over every input a system's exposed
`logic()` admits, so it covers every trace that system can emit — but a system exposing no logic gets
no escape at all, and neither does a duty written in any other temporal shape
([`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md), *the trace is a sample*; `ROADMAP.md` §1). Every duty
about behaviour *over a lifetime* — retention, continuous monitoring — is still met by a check over
one supplied run wherever that escape does not reach. Also missing:
any defence against the insured. The one duty that reads an approximation error reads a number the
system declares about itself, which nothing verifies — it rewards the measurement, not the accuracy,
and a system that under-reports passes ([`docs/findings-nesyarena.md`](docs/findings-nesyarena.md),
finding 1). And the one fairness property that now ships is invariance under a single named
protected variable — a duty about *treatment*, blind to a proxy and blind to a disparate impact,
which is where a large share of the liability actually sits and which no criterion on this evidence
model can reach (`ROADMAP.md` §3; [`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md),
`ecoa_reg_b_1002_4_a_no_disparate_treatment`).

**Regulators** wanting a report to stand as supervisory evidence. Missing: authority over the
vocabulary a duty's reach is written in. A duty now names the decision domains it is about, and a
system that has declared none is reported `not applicable` rather than `satisfied` — the ECOA
adverse-action duty that once cleared a graph-reachability benchmark issuing no credit no longer
reaches it ([`docs/findings-nesyarena.md`](docs/findings-nesyarena.md), finding 3). But the domain
vocabulary is written in this repository and by no regulation, because no statute defines one, so a
not-applicable verdict reports a classification a pack author made rather than a finding about the
statute's reach — and nothing checks that a system declaring `consumer-credit` issues credit
([`docs/authoring-packs.md`](docs/authoring-packs.md), *the decision-domain vocabulary is yours*).
Missing too: authority over the refinement. Which formula stands for a
clause is a judgement made in this repository and recorded as such — the `scope_statements_local_vs_global`
proxy carried by 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2) is the pack author's, and the regulation names nothing of the
kind ([`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md)). The false positive this section used to report is
gone: 12 CFR 1002.9(a)(2) is formalised as the either/or it is, and (b)(2) now carries the trigger
the clause states in its own first words — it governs the statement *required by paragraph
(a)(2)(i)* — so a creditor lawfully using the disclosure alternative is no longer reported violated.
What replaced it is smaller and is stated rather than hidden: where that creditor's log carries no
statement of reasons, the trigger fired nowhere, so (b)(2) is reported **not evaluated** — naming
the antecedent that never fired and the domain that was searched — rather than `satisfied`
([`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §4). That is the honest report of a duty nothing was
learned about, and it is still not the honest *verdict*: `not applicable` is, per decision, and the
result model cannot express one. A supervisor is told the duty was not answered on this log and is
not told that the creditor was in the clear.

**Auditors** running this against a client's system. Missing: reach into systems that are only logs.
For any system exposing nothing but a decision trace, `observed` is the ceiling whatever the pack
asks ([`docs/findings-nesyarena.md`](docs/findings-nesyarena.md), finding 2) — and most audited
systems are logs. Missing also: an adversarial default. reasonsmith checks what a system says, not
whether it was honest: a declared capability set, a trace and exposed logic are each taken at their
word, and where exposed logic and the trace disagree the proof is reported and the trace is never
read for that duty ([`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §3, §3.5). And no cryptographic
signature is verified anywhere in this repository — a `signer` field is checked for being non-empty
([`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md), Table 7 Art. 12 row), so the evidence chain is
unattested.

**Researchers** comparing systems or engines. This is the audience the tool is closest to usable
for: [`docs/findings-nesyarena.md`](docs/findings-nesyarena.md) is a real run against five
`nesyarena` provenances, and `docs/nesyarena-conformance-report.md` is its regenerable evidence.
Missing: properties worth differentiating a system on, and the fifth pack moved this the wrong way.
Twenty-one of the twenty-nine shipped requirements are now presence checks, up from thirteen of
nineteen, against three `logical`, four `temporal` and one `counterfactual` one — so a battery of engines mostly agrees by
construction, and more so than before `packs/gpai.toml` shipped. That pack's eight Article 53 and 55
duties are document-production duties, for which presence is the correct refinement and no stronger
property exists to write; the breadth is real and it is not depth
([`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) §4). The two duties that moved show both what closes this gap and how
narrow each opening is. 12 CFR 1002.9(b)(2) can now be *failed* by a plain decision log, because the
clause supplies its own list of statements that are insufficient — which is available only where a
clause does that, and still establishes nothing about whether what was said instead was adequate.
The same clause's second duty differentiates hardest and reaches fewest systems: it compares the
reasons a notice states against the reasons the decision's own inference used, measured by the
reason-deletion certificate over an artefact the system exposes, and a system that cannot be opened
up is reported *unattainable* rather than returned to the presence check
([`docs/semantics.md`](docs/semantics.md) §3, *certificate*).
Missing also: independence. The packs are authored here, so a cross-system
comparison measures this repository's refinement as much as it measures the systems — a benchmark
needs a pack set whose fourth column someone other than its author has reviewed
([`docs/refinement.md`](docs/refinement.md)).

## Roadmap

[**`ROADMAP.md`**](ROADMAP.md) is the public backlog: five numbered objectives, each with the gap
it closes, a measurable outcome that fails today, and what it depends on — including the one that
is deliberately blocked and why. It also lists what is deliberately *not* planned, so a proposal
for one of those gets an answer rather than silence.

The repository has [`good first issue`](https://github.com/eduardstan/reasonsmith/labels/good%20first%20issue)
work sized for a first contribution, and the question that most needs outside answers — *which
regulation should the next pack cover?* — is open in
[Discussions](https://github.com/eduardstan/reasonsmith/discussions/54). [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md)
has the setup, the verification commands and the standing rules.

## Limits

**Status: Early research software. Nothing here is a compliance guarantee, and none of it is legal advice.**

- A certificate speaks only about the specific program, base interpretation, and query tested.
- Table 7 completeness checks the **form** of a record, never the truth or accuracy of its contents.
- Static capability analysis (`unattainable`) checks declared or trace-derived signal names, not operational runtime correctness.
