"""The `--json` envelope carries its own shape version, and the shape is pinned to it.

`JSON_SCHEMA_VERSION` is the promise a consumer of `reasonsmith check --json` parses against.
A promise nothing checks is a comment, so the two key sets below are written out literally: a
key removed, renamed or retyped fails these tests, and the only way to make them pass again is
to change the expected shape *and* the number in the same edit. That is the whole mechanism —
it catches a shape change made without moving the version, and it deliberately does not try to
catch a change in what a key *means* while its name and type stay put. No machinery exists for
that, and the convention on `JSON_SCHEMA_VERSION` states the obligation instead.

Adding a key is not a breaking change under that convention, so `_TOP_LEVEL_KEYS` is checked
for equality all the same: the point is that someone adding a key must come here, read the
convention, and decide. An assertion of "at least these keys" would let the decision be skipped.
