"""Conformance tests for `docs/language.md`: the grammar, and the monitor's reading of it.

What this module is for:
  `docs/language.md` defines the property language — a grammar, a denotation, and four
  implementations of that denotation. A grammar nothing generates from is a comment, and a
  denotation nothing executes is prose with notation in it. This module is what makes both
  checkable:

  - the EBNF block in the document is compared against `rulelang`'s own call-name constants, so a
    call added to the language and not to the grammar fails the build;
  - specs are generated from the productions of that grammar and asserted accepted, and placed in
    the fragment the generator built them for;
  - every refusal the document names by id is refused, and every refusal this module knows is
    named there — the two halves of one pin;
  - the four lexical decisions the document settles are asserted rather than described;
  - the `observed` implementation is held to the reference reading, with its four divergences
    named rather than averaged away.

What a reader must not break:
  - `MONITOR_DIVERGENCES` is an exclusion list, and an exclusion list that can grow silently is
    worthless. `test_the_shapes_the_monitor_misrenders_are_the_four_named` asserts each row still
    diverges, so a fix to `engines/observed.py` fails this file and says so, and
    `test_the_monitor_agrees_with_the_reference_reading` fails if a *new* shape diverges.
    Why this matters: these are four places where two implementations of one semantics answer
    differently. Silently widening the list turns a finding into a habit.
  - The refusal table is keyed by the ids `docs/language.md` §1.7 uses. Renaming one there without
    renaming it here fails, which is the point.
